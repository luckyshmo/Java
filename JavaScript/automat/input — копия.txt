Reading Academic English is aimed at post-secondary-school students
whose native language is not English and who are studying at academic
institutions. The objective of this program is to introduce students to the
genre of academic texts, to train them to use efficient reading strategies
and to provide them with skills for reading on their own.
The program offers independent modules that can be combined in a
variety of ways to suit individual class or student needs. These include:
•	 Guided Reading: graded texts with tasks for before, during and after
reading, including close reading work with language forms
•	 Skills: explanations and extensive practice in interpreting language
signals – such as sentence structure, verb forms, discourse markers and
substitute words – to unlock meaning
•	 Appendix: glossary of academic words and list of affixes for reference
Reading Academic English can be used for a range of levels, with texts
ranging from simplified press articles of general interest to authentic
academic journal articles dealing with topical issues in education.

Reading Academic English is aimed at post-secondary-school students whose
native language is not English and who are studying education at academic
institutions. It is designed for use as a textbook, within the framework of a course.
The objective of this book is to introduce students to the genre of academic
texts, to train them to use efficient strategies in reading these texts and to provide
them with skills for working independently.
Underlying our approach is a belief that, more than anything else, the reader
needs to learn how to read – what steps to take in approaching a text and what
steps to take when he/she encounters difficulties. If this training is provided, the
student will more readily approach new texts and be able to deal with independent
study.
In addition, it is important that the reader be made aware of each step and
understand its purpose. That is, students need to be taught not only what to do but
also why they are doing it. They need to understand the purpose of each stage in
the reading process:
•	 Before reading: During this stage, readers should approach a text globally, note
all the obvious signals that the text provides and awaken their own knowledge
of the subject. This allows them to make predictions about the text content and
hypotheses about its organization.
•	 While reading: During this stage, readers should keep in mind what they are
looking for. They should pay attention to discourse markers, identify important
ideas and distinguish them from supporting material, find organizational
patterns and guess the meaning of words from context.
•	 After reading: At this stage, readers can check their comprehension, summarize
the text, analyze the writer's purpose, make inferences and apply the information
and message to their own lives. In addition, it is at this stage that readers can
look closely at the language of a text in order to learn from it and add it to their
language repertoire (e.g., vocabulary, syntactic patterns, discourse markers) for
use with other texts.
In order to encourage students to approach texts independently and to work
through the material with ease, an attempt has been made to present the texts in
order of language complexity, going from simplified press material to authentic
academic journal articles.
Topic areas have been chosen to be of interest to students. The early ones tend to
be about topics of general interest, while the majority of journal articles deal with
issues in the field of education.
Preface
Preface
6 Reading Academic English/ Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder, Sarah Feingold
Based on the belief that a course should be flexible and allow for various learning
styles, we have organized the material into sections that can be used modularly.
This allows the instructor and students to suit the course to their specific needs. For
more details on how to use and combine the various sections, see To the Instructor
(page 7-9) and the specific guidelines at the beginning of each section.
The authors would like to express their thanks to the staff – past and present
– of the English Academic Reading Department at Kibbutzim College.
The text analysis questions have been partly adapted from Segev-Miller's
(1993) Model of Generic Questions

For most students, the reading of academic texts is not a simple task. They are
usually not familiar with the genre, the content, the patterns of organization or
the vocabulary. When faced with such texts in a foreign language, they are often
discouraged and resort to inefficient coping strategies (such as word-for-word
translation) that prevent them from getting at the ideas expressed in the texts.
This program is aimed at such students. Its main purpose is to help them develop
the skills, strategies and confidence they need for coping with academic texts in
English – for them a foreign language. The program contains various types of
materials, which can be used in various combinations, depending on the learning
needs and styles of your students.
The program consists of four parts
Guided Reading
This section provides guidance and practice in strategies for efficient reading. It
offers a wide range of texts, each accompanied by guidelines that lead the student
through the reading process. Each text comes with specific tasks for before, during
and after reading.
BEFORE YOU READ - Here students are guided to think about the subject,
predict content and then to skim the text in order to get a general impression.
WHILE YOU READ - These tasks guide the students to read with a purpose in mind.
AFTER YOU READ - This section is divided into two parts:
•	 How much did you understand? - These are simple comprehension questions,
whose purpose is to show students how much they have understood and to
build their confidence.
•	 Text Analysis - Here students are asked to answer text analysis questions
that require thinking about the writer's purpose and point of view, as well as
organization of the text.
CLOSE READING - In this section students examine and work with the language
forms that appear in that particular text, thereby building a corpus of useful
language forms for future use.

An attempt has been made to present these texts in ascending order of difficulty.
However, since level of difficulty is a complex issue, you should choose texts
according to your own students' needs and interests. The main thing to remember
is that students want to read about issues that are relevant to their lives and careers.
Encourage them to choose articles of interest to them and to discuss the issues
presented.
Skills
The main purpose of this section is to show students how to use the signals that a
text offers in order to unlock meaning. It presents the various keys to meaning and
shows the student how to recognize them and interpret them. Students are given
explanations and practice in seeing sentence structure, the verb phrase, discourse
markers and substitute words as keys to meaning.
The Skills section can be approached as a separate module, with students
working through all the parts consecutively under the instructor's guidance. An
alternative approach is to use it as an adjunct to the Guided Reading section,
referring students to the explanations and practice as the need arises - that is, when
they encounter a particular problem in interpreting a text.
Additional Texts
This section contains mainly authentic academic journal texts. The texts are
accompanied only by text analysis questions. No guidelines for reading are
provided. These texts are therefore suitable for students who have already acquired
the basic strategies practiced in Guided Reading. They can be used as practice
tests or as enrichment for more advanced students.
Appendix
This is basically a reference section for students to use while they are reading.
•	 The Glossary of Academic Words provides a list of high-frequency words that
appear in academic texts, and can be used both as a dictionary and as a tool for
vocabulary building.
•	 Students will find the list of Prefixes, Suffixes & Roots useful when trying to
decode the meaning of words.
•	 The List of Irregular Verbs can be used for finding the base form of irregular
verbs before looking them up in a dictionary.
If students are given careful instruction in how to use these reference aids, they
will find them invaluable in their quest to become independent readers.

Reading Academic English provides you with independent modules that can be
combined in a variety of ways. It allows you to choose the route best suited to your
students. You may want to approach the Skills Section and the Guided Reading
section separately, as parallel courses. You may prefer to approach the course
through the Guided Reading section, dipping into the Skills section as needed.
You may want to assign parts of the Skills section as homework, even assigning
different parts to different students. Whichever route you choose, we believe that
this program will increase your students' confidence and motivation, as well as
improve their skills. It is our hope that, by improving their academic literacy, we
are also opening up new worlds to them.

10 Reading Academic English/ Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder, Sarah Feingold To The Student
The Aim of this Program
During your studies, you are continually faced with the need to read academic
articles in English. Your job is to grasp the ideas expressed in these articles.
However, you may often find yourself discouraged because of your unfamiliarity
with their style, language and organization. The aim of this program is to help you
cope with this task. For this purpose, you will be given guidance and practice in a
variety of skills and strategies.
How to Use the Program
Guided Reading
In this section you will find the following:
•	 an introduction, which gives you general guidelines on what to look for in a
text and how to read it
•	 a range of texts, each accompanied by a worksheet with tasks to do before,
while and after reading. (The texts appear in approximate order of difficulty.)
By reading these texts and working through these worksheets, you will improve
your reading strategies, your comprehension, your text analysis abilities and
your language skills.
Skills
In this section you will find explanations and practice in the following skills:
•	 analyzing English sentences
•	 identifying the information that verbs give us
•	 identifying markers that signal important ideas in a text
•	 identifying what substitute words (such as "it, they, such") really refer to
If you take the time to read these explanations and do these practice exercises, you
will gain important skills for understanding English texts.
Additional Texts
This section contains additional texts, each one accompanied only by text analysis
questions. Working through these will give you useful preparation for exams.
To The Student 11
Appendix
In this section, you will find three lists to help you as you read:
•	 Glossary of Academic Words - to give you the meaning of words and phrases
that often appear in academic texts
•	 Prefixes, Suffixes and Roots - to help you discover the meaning of words by
looking at their parts
•	 List of Irregular Verbs - to help you understand how to look these verbs up in
the dictionary
We hope the skills you gain from this program will serve you not only in your
studies, but also in your future careers.

 Using The Guided Reading Section
The texts in this section are presented in order of difficulty. We suggest that the instructor make sure
students are working at a comfortable level of difficulty.
Each text is accompanied by activities that lead the student through three main stages of the reading
process:
Before
? Tasks that encourage students to think about the subject and to predict content
? Vocabulary list that can be used to introduce key words and thus prepare students for the content
While
? Questions for students to think about as they read the text
After
? Reading comprehension questions (How much did you understand?) to ensure that students have
a basic understanding of content before going on to text analysis. These can also be done orally.
? Text analysis questions that train students to look for what is important in a text – the ideas, the
points of view and the way the writer supports these in the text. These questions train students to
separate ideas from supporting material and to look for the function of blocks of material in a text.
It is useful to use these questions in conjunction with the list of Discourse Markers (pages 139-142).
? Close reading activities that focus on the language devices of each text, particularly those that
may be useful to the student in further reading. These might be a particular sentence structure, the
meaning of a verb tense or modal verb, important vocabulary items (such as language for cause and
effect) or markers that signal the writer's message.
 General Guidelines For The Student
What to look for in a text
Topic
Ask yourself:
What is the text about (what general topic and what specific aspect of the general topic)?
For example, a text might be about art (general), specifically about art in education, and more specifically 
18 Reading Academic English/ Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder, Sarah Feingold
about art for children with learning difficulties. The topic of a text is usually announced in the title or
subtitle.
The main idea
Ask yourself:
What does the writer say/claim/argue1
/believe about the topic? What statement does the writer make
about the topic? What is the writer's opinion/point of view about the topic?
Sometimes the main idea is simply information, but often it is a specific point of view, an argument2
 or
a claim. Usually the writer states the main argument explicitly in one or more sentences, but sometimes
the reader needs to infer3
 it from the text.
How the text is organized
Ask yourself:
What are the main sections of the text? What does the writer present/give us in each section?
How the writer supports the main idea
Ask yourself:
What does the writer give us in the text to support the main idea/argument/point of view?
What does the text offer to persuade us to believe the writer's claim/argument/ point of view?
What does the writer use to convince us?
Does the text contain explanations, examples, factual information or research reports to strengthen the
argument?
Writer's purpose
Ask yourself:
Why has the writer written this article? What message does the writer want to bring across?
Writers have reasons for writing. Very often writers have more than one reason.
Here are some possible reasons: to provide information, to convince the reader about something, to suggest
solutions to a problem, to motivate readers to change something ( a call to action).
1 argue = לטעון
2 argument = טעון
3 to infer = להסיק

Tips on how to read a text
Before you actually read it:
Do This Purpose
Look at the title •	 to try to predict the general topic
Explore information outside the text
(photos, captions, subheadings)
•	 to find the source (where it appeared)
•	 to predict the specific aspect of the topic
Think about the subject •	 to find out what you already know about it
Skim the article more than once
•	 The first time, pass your eyes
over it very quickly.
•	 The second time, look at the first
sentence of paragraphs and at
discourse markers.
•	 to get a general impression of the contents and organization
•	 to check if you predicted the topic
•	 to see what some of the subtopics are
•	 to get a global picture of the organization of the article
•	 to find out the topics of paragraphs
•	 to see which paragraphs go together to form blocks
•	 to find main ideas
While you read it:
If you have trouble with the meaning of words or phrases:
•	 Read 'around' the word – the whole sentence and the sentences before and after it.
•	 Try to guess the general meaning of the word/phrase, from its context and its form.
•	 Use a dictionary only if these steps don't work. (Remember to keep the context
in mind when you choose the correct meaning from the dictionary.)
•	 Explain the ideas to yourself, using other words.
If you have trouble with the meaning of sentences:
•	 Read the sentences around it.
•	 Pay attention to discourse signals that help you understand how parts of a sentence are connected
(for example: "and, but, or, so, although, because, in order to")
•	 Try to analyze the sentence.
- Find the main clause and its subject and verb.
- Look at the additions to the main clause. What questions do they answer?
If you have trouble understanding what a substitute word ("it, this, that" etc.) refers to:
•	 Read the whole sentence and the sentences around it.
•	 Decide if the substitute word refers to a specific word or phrase OR to an idea.
•	 Draw an arrow from the substitute word to what it refers to.

 Texts With Worksheets
TEXT 1: WHAT KIND OF MORNING PERSON ARE YOU?
1. BEFORE YOU READ
a. Look at the title.
1. What do you think this text is about?
2. What kind of morning person are you? How do you feel in the morning?
3. Is it easy or difficult for you to get up in the morning?
4. How do you react if someone tries to wake you up?
b. Skim the text very quickly, to get a general impression.
Is this a story or a description of types?
c. Vocabulary – These words and phrases will help you understand the text:
alarm clock, annoying, awake, ball of energy, behave, complain, (to) hate, lazy, (to) need, often,
punishment, sleepyhead, sleep through, snooze, (to) stretch, suffer, tasks, type, unless
2. WHILE YOU READ
Think about:
1. How many types of morning people does the article describe?
2. What signals help you find the types?
3. Can you divide the text into sections?
WHAT KIND OF MORNING PERSON ARE YOU?
What kind of morning person are you?
What are you like in the morning? How do
you behave? You probably belong to one
of the following three types: those who
hate mornings, those who sleep through
them or those who like them. Those who
hate mornings are often called "grumps".
Grumps hate waking up in the morning and
if you try to wake them up, they complain
and make you suffer. It's a good idea to
stay as far away from a morning grump
as possible, unless you like punishment.
The second type of morning person is
the kind who always says "give me just
another minute" and then stretches "another
minute" into 30 or 40 minutes with the
help of a snooze alarm. She often sleeps
right through the morning and is late for
everything. The last kind of morning person
is the most annoying, because he actually

likes mornings. For him, there is no need
for an alarm clock. He always gets up early,
bright-eyed and happy to face a new day. In
fact, he usually finishes his morning tasks
long before anyone else is even awake. This
is the kind of morning person who makes
everyone else look lazy. So what kind of
morning person are you? Are you a grump,
a "just-another-minute" sleepyhead or a
bright-eyed ball of energy?
Adapted from Reading Skills for Beginners 1,
Bar-Ilan University, 1998.
3. AFTER YOU READ
a. How much did you understand?
1. How many kinds of morning people does the writer describe?
2. What name is given to people who hate mornings?
3. Explain in your own words the sentence: "It's a good idea to stay as far away from a morning grump
as possible, unless you like punishment." (lines 10-12)
4. What does the second type usually do when you wake her up?
b. Text Analysis Questions
1. List and briefly describe the 3 types of morning people.
2. What is the writer's definition of "grumps"?
3. What is the writer's aim in writing this text?
4. Why does the writer call the last kind of morning person "the most annoying"?
What is the writer's attitude to this kind of morning person?

2. How many solutions has the speaker found?
MY MORNING
The same thing happens to me every single
workday morning – I can't seem to get out
of bed. When I hear the alarm clock ring,
I imagine all kinds of possibilities, such
as calling in sick or at least saying I'll be
late. However, being a practical person, I
somehow get out of bed and go to work.
How do I do it? I have found a few solutions
to my morning problem.
First of all, I go to sleep early every weekday
night, so that I will get plenty of sleep.
Although most people only need six to
eight hours of sleep, I have found that eight
to nine hours is better for me. When I get
enough sleep, I feel rested, and I'm even in a
better mood. Secondly, I prepare everything
the night before, such as making my lunch
sandwiches and putting out the clothes
that I'm going to wear the next morning.
However, there is always one thing that I
leave for the morning – taking a shower; my
morning shower helps me wake up faster.
Actually, the shower is the only thing I look
forward to when I get up in the morning.
Finally, I set the alarm clock 30 minutes
ahead, so that I'll have 30 minutes to snooze.
That extra snoozing time makes me feel as
though I'm sleeping late. These three simple
steps have helped me tremendously. Believe
it or not, I've even come to work on time for
the last two weeks.

FOOD - THE CHOICE IS YOURS
1 Food directly affects your physical and
emotional health. If you eat non-nutritious
junk food and do not pay attention to your
diet, then you pay the price of poor health
or become severely overweight. If you eat
good food and control what you eat, your
chances of being healthy are much better.
The place to begin a healthy lifestyle is in
your choice of food, that is in your diet.
2 A diet is a plan for eating. People follow
diets for many reasons. Some people go on
diets in order to lose weight. They avoid
foods that are high in calories and fats, and
instead eat foods that are nutritious but not
fattening. Others, such as bodybuilders and
fitness enthusiasts, go on special diets to
gain weight. They eat food high in protein
in order to build muscle, increase their body
weight, and improve their appearance.
3 Many people follow diets as a way of
life. Their goal is not to lose or gain
weight, but simply to stay healthy. Healthconscious
dieters pay careful attention to
the nutritional value of the foods they eat.
Many of them nowadays eat only food that
is grown organically. There are also those,
such as vegetarians, who do not eat animals.
They do this either because they believe that
meat is bad for the health and that avoiding
it lengthens their lives, or simply because
they love animals and are therefore against
eating them.
4 Whatever diet you follow, you must be
careful not to go to extremes. Extreme diets
can be dangerous. For example, there is the
danger of developing an "eating disorder"
– the term used for unhealthy overeating or
undereating. One of these, the compulsion
not to eat, is called "anorexia". It often
begins as a harmless diet, but later can
become a serious and dangerous illness.
5 Your lifestyle affects your attitude to food.
However, the opposite is also true - your
attitude and choice of food can affect your
lifestyle. It is in your power to lead a healthy,
active life. The choice is yours.

UNDER STRESS? HERE'S A GOOD WAY TO RELAX
1 When you are nervous, you automatically
tense your muscles. Your breathing is also
affected, and you begin to take quick,
shallow breaths. Although this is a natural
reaction to being under stress, it is actually
not good for you.
2 Long ago, in prehistoric times, this stress
response served an important purpose.
When early humans found themselves
in danger, their muscles tensed and their
breathing became quick and shallow. These
changes made it possible for them to run
away quickly or to fight. Thus the stress
response was once very useful. In our times,
however, the causes of stress are usually
different and there is seldom a need to run
or fight. Nevertheless, the stress response of
our bodies is the same – our muscles and
breathing are still affected. Because there is
no need to run or fight, the tension is not
released and the stress builds up.
3 The best way to counteract this unwanted
stress response is to breathe deeply and
slowly – actually the opposite of how you
breathe when you are under stress. This
may sound simple, but many of us have
forgotten how to do it. It may be worth
reviewing the mechanics of deep breathing
and how it helps us.
4 Most of us have forgotten how to breathe
deeply. When we were babies we did it
naturally. If you watch the way a baby
breathes, you will notice that the area below
the chest goes in and out. As adults we don't
breathe that way. Instead we breathe from
the chest itself and take shallower breaths.
As a result, we take in less oxygen. Since
oxygen is carried throughout our system
by the blood, if there isn't enough oxygen,
the blood has to move through the system
faster. This causes higher blood pressure.
5 By breathing deeply, you can reverse these
negative effects. It's worth taking a few
minutes to practice this breathing. You
don't have to lie down. In fact you can do it
sitting or even standing, as long as you are
wearing loose, comfortable clothes. First
of all, breathe in through your nose to the
count of five. As you do this, silently say
the word "in" to yourself and let your lower
abdomen fill with air. Then breathe out to
the count of five, this time silently saying
the work "out". Do this deep breathing for
at least two minutes each time. Slowly you
will find that you can count to ten or more
as you breathe in and out. The longer the
breath takes, the deeper it is and the better it
will relax you.
6 The effects of deep breathing go much
further than just relaxation. By helping you
let go of tension, deep breathing can relieve
headaches, backaches, stomach-aches and
sleeplessness. It does this by releasing
endorphins, the body's own painkillers, into
the system. The increased oxygen intake
allows blood pressure to return to normal and
this is good for your heart. The good effects
are not only physical, but also emotional,
since deep breathing allows emotions to
come to the surface. There is no question that
this is one of the best techniques you can find
for relaxing your body and your mind.

THE TV IS ON BUT WHO'S WATCHING?
1 Many of us worry about the effects of
television on family life. We think that we
spend too much time watching television and
that it takes us away from more important
activities, such as reading, exercising and
talking to family and friends. But is this
really true?
2 Studies have shown that people in the United
States do spend a lot of time in front of their
television sets. About 98% of American
homes have at least one TV set, and in the
average home the TV is on more than six
hours a day. But how much attention do
people actually pay to the programs? And
do people who watch TV really spend less
time on other free-time activities?
3 Recently some researchers in New York City
tried to find the answers to these questions
by conducting a telephone survey. They
phoned more than a thousand people all over
the United States and asked them questions
about how they spend their free time.
4 No one was surprised to find out that
watching TV is the most popular free-time
activity in the United States. More than
70% of those asked said that they watch TV
every day or almost every day. The second
most popular activity that they mentioned
was reading the newspaper. Listening to
music at home was third, talking on the
phone to friends and relatives was fourth
and doing some form of exercise was fifth.
5 But the researchers discovered an
interesting fact about Americans' TV habits.
According to this survey, although most
people turn the TV on every day, they do
not actually watch it very much. Six out of
ten people said that when the TV is on, they
seldom pay attention to it. During a typical
television program, they may eat dinner, do
housework, read a newspaper or magazine,
talk to their children or even read to them.
The TV may be on, but it is just background
music.
6 The researchers therefore concluded that
television does not take Americans away
from more important activities. It doesn't
keep them from doing other free-time
activities. In fact, when they compared
people who frequently watch TV and those
who seldom watch TV, they found that there
were no great differences in their other
activities. The frequent watchers read to
their children and talk to their families just
as much as the others.

OVERWEIGHT? START EXERCISING!
1 We are all aware that exercise is important.
We know we should be doing it, but
something always seems to keep us from
getting started. There are many of us. In
the USA, more than 60 percent of the
population gets little or no exercise, even
though we have been reminded time and
again of the wonderful effects of regular
physical activity on body and mind.
2 Americans constantly go on diets, yet in the
last three decades we have become fatter
and fatter, despite the fact that we actually
consume fewer calories than in the past.
Since body fat cannot appear out of thin air,
the explanation for our increasing weight
must be that we are using up a lot fewer
calories than we are consuming.
3 It isn't difficult to figure out why this is
so. All we have to do is look around at our
lives. We are surrounded by machines and
gadgets that make moving unnecessary:
remote control TVs, radios and DVDs,
automatic gear shift cars, elevators
and escalators, washing machines and
dishwashers, computers and fax machines,
e-mail at home and in the office, catalogue
and Internet shopping, motorized lawn
mowers, and so forth and so on. We
hardly have to lift a finger to get through
the day. And, to be sure, most of us don't.
According to one exercise expert, if we
spend two minutes an hour of each workday
sending e-mail to office mates instead
of walking down the hall to talk to them,
we will eventually accumulate the caloric
equivalent of 11 pounds of body fat in a
decade.
4 The problem is body fat. Compared to
muscle tissue, body fat needs fewer calories
to maintain itself. As a result, as we gain
weight, our metabolic rate - the number
of calories we use up minute by minute -
drops and we gain even more weight. This
results in the vicious cycle of inactivity and
weight gain that many of us suffer from.
5 On the whole, Americans don't exercise
much. In fact, fewer than one-fifth engage
in regular, sustained, vigorous physical
activity, the kind that makes them sweat a
little, the kind that lowers the risk of chronic
diseases and early death. There is mounting
evidence that such physical activity can
greatly reduce the risk of developing and
dying of heart disease, stroke, diabetes,
hypertension and osteoporosis. Despite all
this evidence, the proportion of Americans
who engage in this kind of exercise has not
increased since the mid-1980's.
6 Prompted by this lack of progress, some
leading health authorities have decided
to make changes in the advice they offer
the public. Instead of pushing everyone to
exercise at their so-called target heart rate
for at least 20 minutes at a time at least
three times a week, experts now suggest a
more practical approach. They recommend
that we do 30 minutes or more of only
moderately intense physical activity, but do
it almost every day. They even say that the
30 minutes of daily activity can be divided
into shorter 10-minute segments.

ADDICTED TO... WORK
1 Most people spend eight or nine hours on
the job. They do this because they have no
choice. They need to make enough money for
necessities: food, rent, clothing, transportation,
tuition, and so on. They spend about one-third
of their lives at work, but they hate it. They
complain and count the minutes until quitting
time each day – or the days until their next
vacation.
2 On the other hand, there are some people who
spend many extra hours on the job each week
and often take work home with them. They
actually enjoy work – or they simply can't stop
working. These are the workaholics, addicted
to working. They are as addicted to their jobs
as other people are to drugs or alcohol.
3 In some big cities, workaholism is so common
that people do not consider it to be unusual;
they accept the lifestyle as normal. Government
workers in Washington, D.C., for example,
frequently work sixty to seventy hours a week.
They don't do this because they have to; they do
it because they want to. In the famous blackout
of 1977, hundreds of workaholics in New York
City tried to go to work even though there was no
electricity – and therefore no air conditioning,
elevators, or lights. Many of them went to their
offices anyway. Others sat impatiently on the
steps outside their office buildings and did
paperwork or had business meetings.
4 Workaholism can be a serious problem. Since
true workaholics would rather work than do
anything else, they probably don't know how
to relax; that is, they may not know how
to enjoy movies, sports, or other types of
entertainment. Most of all, they hate to sit and
do nothing. This inability to rest may cause
health problems, such as heart attacks. In
addition, typical workaholics don't pay much
attention to their families. They spend little
time with their children, and their marriages
may end in divorce.
5 Is workaholism always problematic? Maybe
not. Some studies show that many workaholics
have great energy and interest in life. Their
work is so pleasurable that they are actually
very happy. For most workaholics, work and
entertainment are the same thing. Their jobs
provide them with a challenge; this keeps
them busy and creative. While other people
retire from work at age sixty-five, workaholics
usually prefer not to quit. They are still
enthusiastic about work – and life – in their
eighties and nineties.
6 Why do workaholics enjoy their jobs so
much? Mostly because working offers some
important advantages. It provides people
with paychecks – a way to earn a living. And
working offers more than financial security.
It provides people with self-confidence; they
have a feeling of satisfaction when they've
produced a challenging piece of work and are
able to say, "I made that". Psychologists claim
that work also gives people an identity; they
work so that they can get a sense of self and
individualism. In addition, most jobs provide
people with a socially acceptable way to meet
others.
7 It could be said that working is a positive
addiction; maybe workaholics are compulsive
about their work, but their addiction seems to
be a safe – even an advantageous – one.

Guided reading 45
MAKING USE OF YOUR TIME
1 Everybody wastes time. Instead of doing
his homework, the schoolboy watches
television. Instead of writing her essay, the
student goes out with her friends. Instead of
reading his book, the commuter gazes out of
the window. The writer neglects his work,
and wanders around the house making cups
of coffee and daydreaming. They all have
good intentions. But they keep putting off
the moment when they must start work. As
a result, they begin to feel guilty, and then
waste even more time wishing they had
worked.
2 When someone else is organizing our time
for us, as for instance during lessons or
working hours, we are part of a disciplined
routine. When we are responsible for
organizing our own time, however, we
need to draw on our own resources and
use self-discipline. Such self-discipline
is extremely important for self-employed
people, particularly those engaged in such
creative activities as writing. Such people
cannot survive, let alone prosper, unless
they organize their time efficiently.
3 I know two writers who seem to have
learned how to deal with the problem, but
in quite different ways. At one extreme is
Bob, an extremely methodical person. He
arrives at his office at 9 a.m. and is creative
until 12:30. Then at 2 p.m. he returns to
his desk and is creative till 5p.m., at which
point he goes home and switches off until
the following morning. At the other extreme
is Alan, who denies that you can regulate
your creativity in this way, by the clock.
He works in inspired bursts, often missing
meals and sleep in order to write down the
ideas which are in his head. Such periods
of intense activity are usually followed
by days of lethargy, when he just wanders
around his place, listening to Mozart and
flicking through magazines.
4 Their places of work reflect their styles.
Bob's books are neatly arranged on the
shelves by his desk. He can always find the
books he wants, and there is not a single
book in his office that is not directly relevant
to his work. Alan, on the other hand, has
books and magazines all over the place,
some on shelves, some in piles on the floor
and the table, even some on and under his
bed. Moreover, they are about every subject
under the sun, most of them apparently
unconnected with his work. There is no hint
of system or order in Alan's work space.
It seems like a random collection. Yet he
manages to glean from it the most unlikely
information to enrich and enliven his books.
5 Bob, as you might imagine, has a
wonderfully organized filing system, keeps
a diary, and always carries a small notebook
in which to jot down things he has to do.
If Alan even made a list of things to do,
he would immediately lose the piece of
paper on which he had written it. He now
has a new and rather desperate system for
remembering something. He writes it down
on the largest piece of paper he can find.
Then, instead of folding the paper neatly, he
crumples it up and stuffs it into his jacket
pocket, where it makes such an enormous
bulge that he cannot possibly forget that it is
there – until he changes his jacket, of course.

6 Both Bob and Alan have managed to
organize their lives in such a way that
they are able to produce work of very high
quality. Obviously, each works in the way
that suits his character, and it would be
foolish to take either as a model. All the
same, there is a lot we can learn from them.
For example, Bob has the excellent idea of
setting targets for each week. As long as he
is "on target", he doesn't feel guilty about
taking an afternoon off in the middle of
the week. In other words, he occasionally
wastes time deliberately, in the same way
that you might sometimes spend money on
a lunch you could not normally afford. It
seems to be a much better idea to relax and
enjoy your time-wasting than to feel guilty
about it both while you are wasting your
time and afterwards.

GROWING UP EQUAL
When we treat a boy as if he is stronger,
smarter, and more capable than a girl,
both children may end up believing us.
1 Most parents want their sons and daughters
to have equal chances at success as they
venture into the world. Today, equality of the
sexes is largely mandated by public policy
and law. However, outmoded ideas about
gender are still deeply rooted in our culture.
Biased attitudes about sex differences pose
challenging questions for parents.
2 Gender stereotypes are rigid ideas about the
capabilities, behavior, and inherent qualities
that are considered normal for each sex.
We all know what these stereotypes are:
A "feminine" girl should be nonassertive,
accommodating, and somewhat illogical
in her thinking. A "masculine" boy should
be strong, unemotional, aggressive, and
competitive.
3 How are children exposed to these
stereotypes? According to researchers
David and Myra Sadker of The American
University in Washington, D.C., boys and
girls are often treated differently in the
classroom. They found that when boys call
out answers, teachers usually listen and
offer constructive comments. When girls
call out answers, teachers tend to focus on
the behavior rather than the content of the
response and are likely to say something
like, "Please raise your hand to speak."
Pink and Blue
4 Underlying gender stereotypes is the belief
that differences between the sexes are not
only innate and natural, but also somehow
necessary. The emphasis on differences
begins at birth and progresses through
childhood. For example, few people would
give pink bootees to a boy or a blue blanket
to a girl. Later, many of us give girls dolls
and miniature kitchenware, while boys
receive action figures and construction sets.
There is nothing inherently wrong with
girls playing house or boys building things.
The problem arises when certain activities
are deemed appropriate for one sex, but not
the other.
5 "Female stereotypes discourage girls from
acquiring many skills that will allow them
to become economically independent," says
Heather Johnson Nicholson, Ph.D., director
of the National Resource Center for Girls
Inc. "Similarly, male stereotypes discourage
boys from developing skills that will help
them be loving partners and parents".
The Sorting Machine
6 "The fact is," says Nicholson, "that society
functions as a kind of sorting machine where
gender is concerned. In a recent survey, 58
percent of eighth-grade girls but only six
percent of boys earned money caring for
younger children. On the other hand, 27
percent of boys but only three percent of
girls earned money doing lawn work."
7 If we are serious about rearing a generation
to be good workers as well as good parents,
we need to eliminate stereotypes that
discourage boys from caring for younger
children, and those that steer girls away
from science and technology, where many
high-paying jobs exist.

50 Reading Academic English/ Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder, Sarah Feingold
8 Gender stereotypes inevitably get through
to our children, no matter how we try to
filter them out. Nevertheless, by becoming
aware of the messages our children receive,
we can help them develop beyond restrictive
barriers.
"I'm concerned about the way self-worth
is tied to beauty for girls," says Brenda
Schonhaut, a New York City mother. "When
my eight-year-old daughter watches TV,
she sees that the prettiest woman gets the
most attention, and that's the one she wants
to be."
9 "Stereotypes tell girls that how they look is
very important," comments Nicholson. "To
counteract that idea, parents can look for ways
to challenge and support their daughters, and
to encourage confidence in ways that have
nothing to do with physical appearance."
A QUIZ FOR PARENTS
•	 Do you ask your daughter to help with the
yard work and your son to do the dishes and
vice versa?
•	 Do you give boys more leeway than girls
when it comes to rude or rowdy behavior?
•	 Do you give your daughter opportunities to
work with tools, to build and repair things, to
investigate mechanical objects?
•	 Do you give your son chances to take care of
others and praise him for being gentle and
considerate?
•	 Do you expect your daughter to be physically
active and strong, and do you encourage her
to take on physical challenges?
•	 Do you hug your sons as much as you hug
your daughters?
•	 Do you expect your daughter to do as well in
math and science as in other school subjects?

EVERY CLASSROOM TEACHER'S DREAM
by Patricia Handley
A small class offers a connected
community of interested learners who
have more opportunities to collaborate
and to share knowledge.
1 This story might seem like a fairy tale to
many teachers, especially those who have
never taught a small class. Yet it is a story
that needs telling, given that small class size
has proven to increase academic and social
growth among young learners, especially
when they have been in a small class for
several consecutive years.
2 In my 28 years as an elementary school
teacher, I have taught classes with as many
as 29 students. But once upon a time in a
wonderful, magical year, I taught fifteen 2nd
graders—an unforgettable experience that
taught me how effective a teacher could be.
3 Let's start at the beginning. Imagine the first
day of school. You wait at the door of your
classroom to meet the students. When they
enter, with big colorful backpacks strapped
across their shoulders, these young children
look up at you with eyes saying, "See me."
As their teacher, you try to meet each pair
of those searching eyes and respond with
a warm, "Yes, I see you," for you know
that much of your instructional success
is wrapped in that personal connection.
The year I met 15 students at the door, I
kept looking for the rest of the class. We
looked more like a big family than a class.
I immediately noted their individual sense
of importance; no one seemed lost in the
crowd.
Establishing a Successful Classroom
Community
4 This leads me to the first benefit of a smaller
class: the ease of establishing a successful
classroom community. A classroom is
15-95.indd 53 3/10/10 12:14 PM
54 Reading Academic English/ Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder, Sarah Feingold
where life really happens for young children,
with all their fears, joys, curiosities, and
hopes. It is where they will open their hearts
and minds. In a class of 15 students, we
can quickly learn about one another and do
so in more depth. When we start with our
morning meeting to welcome one another,
set the agenda, and establish expectations,
each student offers input; sharing becomes
a responsibility. Students express ideas,
discuss problems, and answer questions.
As a result, they are recognized for their
individual contributions and are invested
in their daily learning activities. They feel
motivated and empowered. What a way to
begin a school day!
5 When there are fewer students in the class,
each one has more opportunity to be heard.
Discussions can be held without the age-old
practice of raising hands. Students learn to
allow classmates to finish speaking, and they
respond in a relevant way. The exchange
of thoughts, philosophies, and opinions
becomes a foundation for a classroom based
on mutual respect and regard. Self-esteem
rises, social interactions are more positive,
and skills of compromise and consensus
develop.
6 Students know what they are missing by
being in a larger class. Listen to three 2nd
grade students in a class of 23 when asked
what might be different if they were in a
smaller class of 15 or 16 students:
•	 "If I were in a smaller class, we would get
to talk more."
•	 "I could ask more questions."
•	 "I could make more friends and be Star of
the Week longer."
More Kid Time
7 I have already alluded to the second benefit
of teaching in a class of smaller size: more
kid time. One of the most powerful teaching
tools is the structuring of time for students
to share knowledge. Students listen to one
another, and they hear with ears that are
tuned to their level of understanding. An
interdependent classroom offers greater
opportunity for in-depth peer collaboration.
With more extensive knowledge of one
another, a key ingredient for successful
group work, students are able to accomplish
more. There are fewer and smaller groups—
and there are more minutes in the day for all
students to share their predictions, findings,
and conclusions.
8 Let's look at an example. Four groups of
four students are working on the study of
air. One group records the different ways
that paper might move through the air and
how that creates changes in speed. A second
group studies how air temperature is affected
by water and ice, and a third group explores
different ways to make air move and create
wind. A fourth group drains juice boxes,
collapses them, and refills them with carbon
dioxide to determine how air takes up space.
9 After they have worked through the
procedures, discussed what has happened,
and reached conclusions, the groups need
time to report to the class and answer
questions, and the teacher needs time to
wrap up the groups' findings with a list of the
physical characteristics of air. With a half hour
allotted, each group would have six minutes
to present their findings, and the teacher
would have six minutes to summarize. But if
there are six groups of four, each group would
15-95.indd 54 3/10/10 12:14 PM
Guided reading 55
have fewer than four and a half minutes to
report—and the teacher would have the
same amount of time to summarize. It may
not sound like a great loss on paper, but over
the course of a six-hour day, those minutes
add up to 30 minutes of student-centered
learning time. You can bet that the quality
of learning in a larger class is more rushed,
less exacting, and more disjointed; you can
also bet that somewhere along the way,
important student voices were not heard.
10 When I have more
students in the
classroom, I am faced
with watering down
a discovery approach
to learning and doing
more summarizing
for students when
it would have been more meaningful for
students to draw conclusions on their own.
Or I am too often obliged to teach by telling
and demonstrating. Yet we all know that
students learn best by doing.
Fewer Discipline Problems
11 With a classroom of students who are
actively engaged, we see
something else: fewer
discipline problems. It is
another great benefit of
smaller class size—and is
a direct result of a more
connected community
where there are busy
hands, active brains, and opportunities
to share knowledge. The teacher can
check in more often with students and
can troubleshoot impending discipline
problems. As Anderson (2000) writes, small
class size "enables teachers to worry less
about managing learners and more about
managing learning."
12 In a small class, the students themselves
can help sort out disruptive behaviors.
In my 15-student class, a set of reading
partners was being disturbed by another
reading team. I called a quick class meeting
on the rug and asked the complaining
students to explain
the problem. Then I
asked them all, "Well,
what should we do?"
The students shared
that it wasn't fair for
the noisy readers to
disturb others who
were trying to concentrate. There were a
few punitive suggestions, like having the
disruptive team members do their reading at
recess time; in the end, though, we decided
to set down some quick rules for partner
reading time. The offenders apologized,
and we went back to our reading block. It
took a few minutes to sort out the problem,
but what it accomplished
was well worth it. We
worked out the problem
as a group, emphasizing
important skills needed to
be part of a community.
If a student slipped up
during the school year, a nod to the posted
rules was all it took to get back on track.
And it wasn't just me giving the reminder;
the students helped monitor one another.
"Before I taught a small class, I
used to say to anyone who would
listen, "Just give me 15 children - no
new materials, no new methodologies
- and watch what can be done."
"When I have more students
in the classroom, I am faced
with watering down a discovery
approach to learning."

Personalized Assessment
13 After many years of teaching, I have
discovered that just a few minutes of oneon-one
time with a student can lead to great
gains in academic achievement. Individual
conferencing is an effective way to spend
one-on-one time. You can keep a running
record in reading to look at key strategies
that a student is misusing or not using at
all; from your information, you can give
that student and any others instruction in
that specific skill. In a writing conference,
you might look at a piece the student is
working on and encourage the student to
think about word choice or the addition
of details. Again, you might find other
students who need help with that skill and
form a small study group. In looking at a
student's portfolio, you might notice a need
for the improvement of the overall quality
of work. In each case, you and the student
will look at the work, discuss how to make
it better, and then allow time for revision or
rewriting.
14 In a class of 23 students, I would need to
have four or five conferences daily to meet
with each student once a week. That is
nearly impossible. In a class of 15 students,
I would have only three conferences a day.
It is easy to see which scenario will produce
more valuable assessment and opportunity
for personalized reteaching or revision,
leading to academic gains.
Using Best Teaching Practices
15 This brings me to my last point. Good
teaching practices don't change; they will
facilitate learning in any classroom. In a
small class setting, teachers have more
opportunities to maximize best teaching
practices—and their students reap the
rewards.
16 Before I had the chance to teach a small
class, I used to say to anyone who would
listen, "Just give me 15 children—no new
materials, no new methodologies—and
watch what can be done." I don't have
statistical evidence to support the facts, but
here's what happened the year my dream
came true: Every student in that class made
at least a year's growth in all academic
areas, and the overwhelming majority
made more than that. Our classroom was
a welcoming environment managed by all
of us. Students tidied up center areas and
book collections because it was their room
to care for. Their portfolios bulged with
work that they had completed, reviewed,
and revised. The students designed a Web
page that told what they were learning and
showcased some of their best work. Each
day, someone brought in something to
enhance what we were studying: turtles,
monarch caterpillars, birds, math games,
rock collections, poems, handmade posters
to hang in the classroom, self-made books,
grandmothers as historians—even baby
brothers. In doing so, the students became
planners and teachers, too. I could tell you
of the personal triumphs and tragedies of
each one of those students because we had
time to talk about them. Although it was
three years ago, I still hear from three of
those students on a regular basis. We were a
connected class.
17 A good teacher is the answer to every
parent's prayer and every child's blessing.
Let's give those good teachers a fighting
15-95.indd 56 3/10/10 12:14 PM

chance by making small class size a valued
reality. As researchers Achilles and Finn
(2000) write:
Class size should not just be a cornerstone,
but the foundation of educational policy for
the early education of America's citizenry. . .
. The small-class effect has been clearly and
amply demonstrated in years of research and
practice, but knowing what to do is only part
of the job. The leadership challenge is how to
get this important thing done. . . . It is the right
thing to do for small children beginning what
should be an enjoyable and productive journey
into learning. (p. 316)
18 Let's not lose our way. We know that small
class size makes a significant difference in
the educational and social lives of children.
Let's act on it.

TEACHING FOR CHARACTER AND COMMUNITY
by Spencer Kagan
When teachers embed character education
in their instruction, the classroom
becomes a more caring, respectful, and
inclusive community.
1 Two women stand on the bank of a
swift river. The current carries a man,
desperately struggling to stay afloat,
toward them. Both women jump into
the water and pull the man to safety.
While the brave rescuers tend to the
victim, the current carries toward
them a second man, also desperate and
screaming for help. Again the women
jump into the river to the rescue. As
they pull out the second victim, they
spot a third man flailing about. One
woman quickly jumps into the water to
save the latest victim. She turns to see
the other woman striding upstream.
"Why aren't you helping?" she cries.
"I am," replies the other woman. "I am
going to see who is pushing them in."
2 Although violence in schools is statistically
on the decline, the number and severity
of incidents of extreme school violence—
of students bringing weapons to school
and killing and injuring classmates and
teachers—have increased. Well-intentioned
educators have responded to this crisis by
jumping into the river: erecting more and
better metal detectors, installing more
sophisticated surveillance cameras, hiring
more resource officers, adopting and
enforcing stricter harassment policies, and
suspending and expelling more students.
The situation, however, demands that
educators walk upstream to identify the
underlying causes of extreme school
violence and develop prevention programs
aimed at addressing these root problems.
School Violence, Student Isolation
3 Examining 37 incidents of extreme school
violence involving 41 perpetrators, the Secret
Service National Threat Assessment Center
concluded that, in more than three-fourths
of the incidents, the attack was planned two
or more days before the shooting (Vossekuil,
Reddy, Fein, Borum, & Modzeleski, 2000).
No consistent demographic profile emerged
of the attackers. Some had histories of
neglect, but others came from intact
families; some were socially isolated, but
others were popular; some were failing in
school, but others were excellent students.
Few were diagnosed with mental illness or
had histories of drug or alcohol abuse.
4 The most important finding to emerge from
the study was that more than three-quarters
of those who had resorted to extreme school
violence had a grievance. Two-thirds of
all attackers felt persecuted, harassed, or
bullied. Many had discussed the harassment
with friends, seeking solutions. Most often
their motive in the violence was to get
revenge or simply to end the harassment.
Attackers described experiences of being
bullied in terms that approached torment.
They told of behaviors that, if they
occurred in the workplace, would meet the
legal definitions of harassment. (Vossekuil
et al., 2000, p. 7)
Fellow students described the treatment that
freshman Andy Williams—who opened fire
15-95.indd 61 3/10/10 12:14 PM
62 Reading Academic English/ Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder, Sarah Feingold
on classmates in a Santee, California, high
school—had received at the hands of peers:
"They'd walk up to him and sock him in the
face for no reason." Kids would burn their
lighters and then press the hot metal against
his neck (McCarthy, 2001).
5 Why are some students singled out
for harassment and isolation? During
adolescence, young people turn from
parents to peers for social and psychological
support. This transition is part of the
universal biological process of forming an
independent identity. Adolescents segregate
themselves into a hierarchy of subgroups.
At the top are the Jocks, Preppies, and
Socialites; in the middle
are the Geeks, Nerds,
Dorks, Surfers, and
Skaters; at the bottom are
the Roamers, Gothics,
Freaks, Losers, and
Dirts. Students in the subgroups at the top
of this hierarchy are respected and admired
by their peers. Students in the bottom
subgroups are often belittled, harassed,
taunted, excluded, and bullied.
6 For those at the bottom of the social pecking
order, exclusion comes at the very time
when their need for inclusion in a peer
group is greatest. As a result, these students
feel isolated, ashamed, and tormented;
some become desperate. When the young
perpetrators of the Columbine (Colorado)
High School shootings resorted to violence,
they were hoping to "kick-start a revolution of
the dispossessed," to "finally get the respect
they deserved" (Aronson, 2000, pp. 85–86).
7 Walking upstream to prevent extreme school
violence means that educators must attempt
to alter the process by which students form
themselves into subgroups—a hierarchy that
promotes the isolation of some adolescents
who may turn to violence out of desperation
and a desire for revenge.
Statistics of a Breakdown
8 School shootings receive a lot of media
attention, but they are just one symptom
of a larger problem: the breakdown of
community, mutual caring, and moral
orientation. Other symptoms are alarming
and widespread:
•	 In a national survey of 15,000 middle and
high school students, 75 percent of boys
and 60 percent of girls reported hitting
someone out of anger in the
last 12 months (Josephson
Institute of Ethics, 2001).
•	 1 in 15 students is
threatened or injured with
a weapon each school year
(Snyder & Sickmund, 1999).
•	 More than 1 in 3 students report that they
do not feel safe at school (Josephson
Institute of Ethics, 2001).
•	 160,000 students skip school each day
because they fear bullies (Bowles, 2001).
•	 54 percent of middle school students
and 70 percent of high school students
cheated on a test in a given year
(Josephson Institute of Ethics, 1998).
•	 47 percent of high school students
reported that they had stolen from a store
in a given year (Josephson Institute of
Ethics, 1998).
A Curriculum of Character
9 In Educating for Character: How Our Schools
Can Teach Respect and Responsibility,
Thomas Lickona (1991) documents the
erosion of virtues such as honesty, respect,
For many students, character
and virtues will be acquired
in school—or not at all.

and caring among today's youth. Although
Lickona and others have been calling for
schools to focus on fostering character for a
decade, the recent spate of school shootings
has made character education—the teaching of
caring, respect, and common virtues—a highpriority
curriculum. Educators can address the
breakdown of community and morality among
students by making
character education a
part of the school's core
curriculum.
10 Indeed, no more
important curriculum
exists. Today's students
will be tomorrow's parents, passing their
values to the next generation. In that sense,
the values and virtues we instill in today's
youth determine our future. Nothing less
than the basic social fabric of our society
is at stake. We must not fail to address the
lack of character and virtues in today's youth;
educators must incorporate the teaching
of character in the school curriculum. For
many students, character and virtues will be
acquired in school or not at all.
11 What are the common virtues that nearly
everyone agrees should be the outcome of
character education? My list includes three
sets of virtues: personal, relationship, and
community.
12 Personal virtues include self-discipline,
impulse control, good judgment, integrity,
courage, perseverance, and self-motivation.
Relationship virtues include caring, kindness,
courtesy, cooperativeness, helpfulness,
honesty, respect, understanding, and tolerance.
Community virtues include citizenship,
fairness, leadership, responsibility, loyalty,
and trustworthiness.
13 Although educators can argue for different
sets of virtues and different ways to categorize
them, few would make the case that society
would be better off if students were dishonest,
uncaring, unfair, irresponsible, unmotivated,
or lacking in good judgment. Educators
have been reluctant to engage in character
education for fear that parents would object.
When asked, however, parents
overwhelmingly applaud any
attempts by schools to foster
common virtues.
14 The need for character
education is clear. The support
for character education is
almost universal. The question then becomes,
How can schools best foster the acquisition
of character and virtues among students?
Approaches to Community and Character
15 Two distinct approaches to fostering inclusive
school communities and positive character
and virtues in students are curricular and
instructional. Curricular approaches include
separate lessons on the virtues, as well as using
the existing curriculum to teach the virtues—
as when the teacher focuses on the virtues
exhibited or not exhibited by a historical or
literary figure. Virtue-of-the-Month and Virtueof
the-Week programs are popular examples of
the curricular approach to character education:
Classroom lessons focus on the importance
of each month's target virtue—for example,
honesty, responsibility, or kindness.
16 By contrast, the instructional approach to
character education is based on the premise that
the implicit curriculum—how teachers teach—is
at least as influential on student learning as the
explicit curriculum—what teachers teach. For
example, before students analyze a poem, their
teacher might introduce them to an instructional
The need for character education
is clear. The support for character
education is almost universal.
15-95.indd 63 3/10/10 12:14 PM
64 Reading Academic English/ Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder, Sarah Feingold
strategy called Paraphrase Passport, in which
each student in a pair or group must paraphrase
the prior speaker before stating his or her
own opinion. Because the teacher encourages
students to use Paraphrase Passport, students
acquire a better understanding of others'
viewpoints, become more empathetic, and
improve their listening skills. A curriculum
is embedded in the instructional strategy
itself, and some would argue that this implicit
curriculum (understanding, empathy, listening)
is even more important for students than the
explicit curriculum (understanding the poem).
If instead their teacher were to lecture about
the poem, students would be far less likely
to develop character and virtues (and, in fact,
would probably be less engaged with the poem).
17 Curricular and instructional approaches
to character education are not mutually
exclusive. While teaching lessons on virtues,
teachers can use instructional strategies
like Paraphrase Passport that promote the
acquisition of virtues. Nevertheless, of the
two approaches, the instructional approach
is more powerful. Why? Because students
practice the virtues daily. If students have
a lesson on understanding or honesty in the
fall and then move on to discuss different
virtues each month, how much more
understanding or honest will those students
be in June? By contrast, if students practice
understanding and honesty throughout the
school year because they are components of
the curriculum and embedded in the way the
teacher teaches, then students may acquire
the habits of being understanding and honest.
Structures for Community and Character
18 Structures are simple, step-by-step
instructional strategies that teachers can
use at any grade level, with any content.
Embedded in many of the structures is
a character development component.
Teachers structure interaction among
students and with the curriculum so that
stuזdents acquire virtues as part of any
lesson, regardless of the content.
19 RoundRobin. For example, teachers might
use one of the simplest of all structures, a
RoundRobin, to engage groups of students
in topical discussions. Seated in small
groups, each student shares his or her ideas
in turn. As the students interact, they learn
to take turns, a form of respect. Instead of
using this structure, the teacher could call on
students one at a time to share their ideas—
but students would not learn to take turns
and honor the contributions of their peers.
20 Corners. To explore the importance of the
opening lines to a story, post the following
four quotes, one in each corner of the room.
Crouched on a branch of a mukuyu tree, a
girl tore open a speckled fruit. She grimaced
as ants scurried over her fingers. So many!
And the inside was full of worms, too.

"Tom!"
No answer.
"What's gone with that boy, I wonder? You,
TOM!"
No answer.
from The Adventures of Tom Sawyer
by Mark Twain

The boy was about 15 years old. He tried to
stand very straight and still when he heard
the news, but inside of him everything had
gone black.
from The Light in the Forest
by Conrad Richter
It was a dark and stormy night.
from A Wrinkle in Time
by Madeleine L' Engle.
21 Using the Corners structure, students
first think about this question: If you read
only the opening lines that are posted,
which book would you most want to read?
Students then write down the number of the
corner corresponding
to their choice, go to
that corner, share with
others in the corner why
they made their choice,
and finally listen to and
paraphrase ideas from
other corners.
22 In addition to deepening their appreciation
of the importance of the lead lines of a story,
students practice character virtues such as
tolerance, understanding, and respect for
opinions different from their own. They often
find they have something in common with
others with whom they might not otherwise
have associated. Over time, Corners builds
community.
23 Other possible content for Corners
includes four possible solutions to a class
problem, favorite type of math problem,
or best explanation of a puzzling science
phenomenon.
24 Folded and Split Agree-Disagree
Line-Ups. Use this structure to explore
controversial subjects—for example, the
moral and scientific issues underlying
President Bush's decision to support
limited research on human embryonic
stem cells. After students read about and
discuss the topic, they line up according to
their agreement or disagreement with the
following statement: Human embryonic
stem-cell research should be allowed. Those
who most strongly agree stand at one end
of the line; those who disagree stand at the
other end; those who have mixed feelings
stand in the middle.
25 After sharing with those near them, students
fold the line so those who
most strongly agree face
students who most strongly
disagree. Each paraphrases
the other's point of view.
Next, the line is unfolded
and split in the middle. One
half of the line slides down
to face the other half, so
those who strongly agree and disagree interact
with those in the middle, again paraphrasing
the other's view. In addition to deepening
their understanding of the risks, benefits, and
moral issues associated with human stem-cell
research, students increase their engagement
with current events, learn respect and
understanding for other points of view, and
practice moral reasoning and the courage to
stand up for their own convictions.
26 Team Statements. To explore and deepen
student understanding of abstract concepts
such as democracy, use the Team Statement
structure. First, working alone, each student
writes a definition of democracy using the
For those at the bottom of the
social pecking order, exclusion
comes at the very time when
their need for inclusion in a peer
group is greatest.

sentence starter "Democracy is . . .." Next, in
teams of four, the students read their personal
definitions, receiving feedback from their
teammates. Finally, students work together to
create a team statement that incorporates the
ideas of all four students. In addition to deepening
their understanding of the essence of democracy,
students learn to respect all points of view and
to synthesize the contributions of everyone.
They are not only learning about democracy
but are also practicing it. (For more examples of
structures, see fig. 1.)

Outcomes of Structures
27 Embedding character education in
instruction has several important
advantages.
28 Structures help teachers avoid the testing
trap. Teachers are under pressure to
teach what will be tested. If they adopt a
curricular approach to character education,
they are likely to abandon that curriculum
in favor of the academic curriculum covered
on standards tests. If character education is
embedded in the instructional strategies that
teachers use regularly, then students will
practice character and virtues even as they
prepare for tests.
29 Structures increase engagement. Teachers and
students find the structures fun and engaging;
structures enliven student interaction with
one another and with the curriculum. Because
structures carry their own rewards, sustained
implementation is likely.
30 Structures help students practice character
and virtues. Students do not develop
character in a single lesson; rather, they
acquire it over time. If teachers use a variety
of structures in the classroom, students can
practice the virtues on an ongoing basis in
a number of different situations—making
it more likely that students will acquire
the virtues as enduring aspects of their
character. A student who has one or two
lessons on kindness may or may not be
kind; a student who practices kindness all
year is very likely to acquire that virtue.
31 Structures build a classroom community.
When teachers use student teams and
cooperative structures regularly, students no
longer segregate themselves into in-groups
and out-groups. Teachers form teams in
ways that ensure that students work as
teammates with those they might otherwise
have excluded. Hence, students who might
not have done so otherwise come to respect
and understand one another. When teachers
use cooperative structures in the classroom,
students name more classmates as friends,
care about more classmates, and feel more
cared about (Kagan, Zahn, Widaman,
Schwarzwald, & Tyrrell, 1985).
Walking Upstream
32 The best way to prevent school violence
is to replace disparagement with respect,
exclusion with inclusion, and lonely
isolation with collaborative community.
When teachers use cooperative structures in
daily instruction, students experience being
cared for by peers and caring for others.
They practice responsibility, fairness,
tolerance, teamwork, understanding, and
respect for different points of view. They
learn to help one another. As students work
together in teams, the "us" and "them" of ingroups
and out-groups become an inclusive
"we". The classroom becomes a respectful,
inclusive community. No curriculum is more
important. When they include structures
as part of their curriculum for community
and character, educators go a long way
toward walking upstream to prevent student
isolation and school violence.

STICKS AND STONES
by Stephen L. Wessler
Language can hurt. Educators, parents,
and community members must help
students become the solution to the
problems of bias, prejudice, and
harassment in schools.
1 During a recent student assembly at a
suburban high school, I asked the students
to raise their hands if they believed that
dangerous weapons were brought to school
on a daily basis. Not surprisingly, not
one hand was raised. I looked around the
auditorium, paused, and told the students
that I believed that each one of them was
wrong. One particular kind of weapon is
brought into their school, and into every
high school and middle school in the United
States, every day: degrading words, slurs,
and put-downs. Recent cases in Maine
schools illustrate some of the critical and
destructive characteristics of degrading
language and slurs.
2 The first case began sometime in early
January when four boys began targeting
another boy – "John" – with antigay
harassment. The harassment began with
whispered slurs and comments as John
walked by in the hallway. Then the four boys
became more brazen. They began making
graphic antigay slurs directly to John. By
the end of January, the boys had taken their
harassment to another level, tripping John
when he walked by or pushing him into a
locker while yelling slurs.
3 Sometime in early February, the four boys
significantly increased the seriousness of
their conduct. On two occasions, several
boys jumped John during the school day.
While one of the boys put him in a head
lock, the other boys—continuing to call
him names—kneed him in the stomach and
groin.
4 Three additional incidents occurred
between late February and early April.
John was jumped in the boys' bathroom
by several of the boys who, while yelling
antigay slurs, pushed his head into a urinal.
In another incident, one of the boys came
up behind John at school and put a noose
around his neck. This was not a string or a
piece of yarn, but a rope tied as a noose. The
boy pulled the rope so tightly around John's
neck that it took John about 35 seconds to
pry his fingers underneath to pull the noose
over his head. Sometimes, when we look at
the second hand of a wall clock and count
to 35, the time goes by pretty quickly. For
John, however, those seconds were probably
the longest moments of his life. Up to this
point, no adult in the school was aware of
any of the harassment and violence directed
at John.
5 The final event occurred when one of the
boys told John that he knew where his
father kept a handgun and that he was going
to bring it to school the next day and shoot
John, another boy who was John's supposed
boyfriend, and then himself. A student
overheard and told a teacher, who told the
principal, who called the police. The police
immediately reported the incident to me as
director of the civil rights unit in the Maine
Attorney General's office.
15-95.indd 71 3/10/10 12:14 PM
72 Reading Academic English/ Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder, Sarah Feingold
6 Two points from this sad series of incidents
bear emphasis. First, the age of the boys.
Each boy, including John, was 12 years old—
7th graders in a K-8 school. Every year since
1992, the number of hate crimes and bias
incidents involving teenagers and younger
children reported by police to the Maine
Attorney General has increased. Second, the
escalation of degrading language and slurs
to more focused harassment and threats and
then to violence was the pattern in virtually
every case of serious hate violence in middle
schools, high schools, and colleges in the
seven years I directed the antihate crime
enforcement effort for Maine.
7 Another case started with a phone call
from a high school principal. He called to
tell me that a student had used a permanent
marker to write
"Kill the Jews" and
to draw a swastika
near some lockers.
The principal asked
for advice, and I
suggested several
concrete steps that
he should take. My last words to him were
that he should expect that some Jewish
students would be terrified. When I hung up
the phone, it rang immediately. I picked it
up thinking that it was the principal calling
back with another question. Instead, it was
the mother of an 11th grade Jewish girl
calling to tell me about the incident. When
I told her that I already knew about it, she
said that her daughter had taken off the
Star of David necklace that she had worn
since 2nd grade. The girl believed she
might be harmed if other students knew she
was Jewish. Even when incidents of bias,
prejudice, harassment, and violence do not
escalate, they can terrorize some students.
8 These two incidents are on the surface
unconnected. But a common denominator
exists: the destructive power of degrading
and violent language. Each incident
illustrates a distinct effect of hateful
words and symbols. The incident of the
boy taunted by four classmates shows the
escalation from language to violence. The
incident of the anti-Semitic graffiti shows
the fear that hateful words and symbols can
create for our students.
Pervasive Use
9 How pervasive is the use of degrading
language? Derogatory language has been
commonplace in schools for a long time.
Most of us heard
degrading language
and slurs when we
were students. But
the use of language
that degrades specific
groups—particularly
groups that appear different in some way—
appears to have increased. Specifically, we
are talking about words that degrade others
because of their gender, race, ethnicity,
sexual orientation, religion, economic
status, and physical and mental disability.
A second set of words appears to have
increased in usage and intensity: words
that threaten violence. It is striking how
quickly—often in a matter of seconds—a
mild argument in a hallway can escalate to
involve violent and threatening language.
10 Not every student uses degrading and violent
Young people today hear hateful
words, slurs, and words of violence
every day as the background noise
of their lives.

words; many do not. But all young people
today hear hateful words, slurs, and words
of violence every day as the background
noise of their lives. They hear them at the
movies, on television, from radio shock
jocks, and on their CDs. Sadly, some young
people hear them from their families. But
most important, they hear them from one
another—on the bus, in the hallway, on the
playground, and in the locker rooms. They
hear them 24/7. The use of degrading and
violent language is pervasive and endemic.
11 Unfortunately, the routine use of slurs and
other degrading language has desensitized
too many students. They cease to understand
or hear the real meanings of the words they
use, and often the only students who truly
realize their impact and meaning are the
boys and girls who are the targets of the
slurs, jokes, and put-downs. The impact
of debasing language on these students is
powerful and destructive.
The Toll
12 The toll students suffer from their exposure
to derogatory language is profound.
13 Escalation. I learned from seven years of
investigating and prosecuting hate crimes in
colleges, high schools, and middle schools
that the violence was never the beginning
of anything. Rather, the violence was the
end of something, and that something was
an escalating pattern of harassment that
started with degrading language and slurs.
It should not be a surprise that if it appears
acceptable to constantly denigrate and
slur, some students will conclude that it is
also acceptable to take words to the next
level. Some students will then conclude
that it is acceptable to go to the next level,
and the next.
14 Words do not exist in a vacuum. When left
unchallenged, words create a culture and an
environment that appear to condone bias,
prejudice, and violence.
15 Fear. This is the hardest point for many of
us to understand. Many of us do not identify
with a word or symbol that can elicit a
strong fear. But many of our students do
experience this kind of fear. The 11th grade
Jewish girl I described earlier is not an
exception. Antigay comments, racist slurs,
and sexually degrading language all carry
an implicit threat of violence. If you are
a 16-year-old African American girl and
someone scrawls "the KKK is back" on your
notebook, what do you believe will happen
next? If you are a gay high school student
and a group comes up to you and yells "get
out of our way, you [antigay slur]," what do
you think will happen if you do not get out
of the way? The answer to both questions is
violence.
16 The fear of violence generated by degrading
symbols and words based on race, ethnicity,
gender, and sexual orientation can be
terrifying and paralyzing. This fear can
lead to other consequences. For some
young people, the fear that slurs, degrading
language, and harassment will get worse
if they tell anyone about them leads them
to deny that the incidents ever occurred.
Unfortunately, this denial intensifies the
fear.
17 Fear can also lead to declining grades. I
have seen too many young people whose
abilities to concentrate and study declined
dramatically in the wake of harassment. You
15-95.indd 73 3/10/10 12:14 PM
74 Reading Academic English/ Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder, Sarah Feingold
cannot learn if you are focusing on whether
you will be safe walking down the halls of
your school. Finally, fear can lead to such
physical and emotional problems as weight
loss, sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression.
18 Rage. Some students who endure slur after
slur, day after day, week after week, reach
the breaking point and snap, hitting back
at the attacker. There is no more difficult
situation for school administrators to handle.
The victim has now committed a serious act
of violence. The student who has engaged
in the harassment has participated in a far
less serious act of misconduct as defined
by school disciplinary policies and the
criminal justice system. When harassment
has proceeded to this point, it often is too
late to do anything but try to pick up the
pieces.
19 Loss of spirit. These are, for me, the
saddest stories. Many of our parents told
us that "sticks and stones may break your
bones, but words can never hurt you."
Students from traditionally targeted groups
understand that sticks and stones may break
your bones, but the words of hate may break
your soul. Too many children lose hope.
Too many gay and lesbian students drop out
of school, too many
students of color
lose faith in a
system that they
expect to educate
them, and too many
girls lose faith
and confidence
in themselves. Tragically, some of these
children become so hurt and lost that they
engage in self-destructive behavior. Some
do not survive.
Interrupting the Language
20 No magic solution exists. We will not
develop one project that will eliminate hate
and prejudice or end violence, but we can
begin to change the culture in which the use
of degrading language and violence appears
acceptable to our students. To do this we
must, in consistent, firm, but low-key ways,
confront the use of these words. Adults
must intervene when degrading language is
spoken.
21 Teachers, administrators, and guidance
counselors have extraordinarily difficult
and important jobs. The hardest situation
occurs when you walk through a busy
hallway and hear a student make a degrading
remark. What do you do? I'll tell you what
your students tell me they want you to do.
They say, "Please, please say something."
Children understand at a very early age
that some other children will be mean to
them. But, at the same time, they trust that
teachers and other adults will protect them.
22 Two additional points make the need to
intervene even more compelling. First,
when a teacher does not respond to
degrading language,
students believe that the
silence means that the
teacher condones those
words. This is not true,
it is not fair, but it is
what students believe.
The students who are
most devastated by degrading language
are those who believe a teacher heard but
When left unchallenged, derogatory
words, slurs, and put-downs create
a culture and environment that
appear to condone bias, prejudice,
and violence.
15-95.indd 74 3/10/10 12:14 PM
Guided reading 75
did not intervene. Second, you cannot tell
which students feel personally targeted
by derogatory words and slurs. If you are
walking through a hallway and you hear
two white boys using a racial slur but decide
not to intervene because there was no target
of the incident, you may be wrong. You do
not know whether the white girl walking
behind you has a favorite first cousin who
is African American or an older brother or
sister who has married a person of color. Our
society is changing rapidly and the number
of people who are deeply and personally
influenced by degrading language and slurs
has increased.
23 What kind of intervention am I talking
about? First, I am not talking about calling
in the SWAT Team. I am not talking about
sending students to the principal's office. I
am not talking about the 35-minute lecture
on the damage created by homophobic,
racist, sexist, or anti-Semitic comments.
24 I am talking about consistent, firm, and lowkey
interruptions of degrading language and
slurs: "We don't talk like that here"; "That
word offends me"; "Language, please!"
25 This kind of intervention breaks the pattern
of escalation from language to more
focused harassment to threats and, finally, to
violence. It significantly reduces the chance
that students will be the victims of serious
violence. As a former prosecutor, I know
that if we can interrupt the language before
it escalates, we dramatically reduce the need
for police and prosecutorial intervention.
26 Intervention also has an extraordinary
impact on the students who feel targeted.
They will remember you. I talk to former
students in their 20s, 30s, and 40s who
remember the teacher who interrupted
degrading language and slurs. Last year, I
spoke with a 57-year-old Arab American
man who moved to the United States when
he was 12. He described an incident that
occurred in an algebra class when he was
16 years old. Some students started taunting
him with ethnic slurs because he was from
the Middle East. His teacher immediately
intervened and stopped the taunts. This man
described the incident as if it had occurred
earlier that morning instead of 41 years
ago. You may not know which students are
affected by your interventions and you may
not even remember when you intervened,
but I have met men and women whose
teachers became their lifelong heroes
simply because those teachers intervened to
stop hurtful and degrading language.
27 Most important, when you interrupt
degrading language and slurs, you become
a role model for your students. You cannot
turn around a culture of slurs and put-downs
by yourself. You need your students' help. I
have seen schools turn around on the issue
of language and civility. I have seen students
begin to speak up in low-key ways. Students
feel empowered, and they empower other
students.
28 Last winter I had a conversation with a 9th
grade boy who does speak up when other
students use degrading language and slurs.
"Mr. Wessler," he said, "I'm getting really
down about this. I keep on telling kids not to
use bad words, but I keep on hearing them."
I had nothing extraordinarily helpful to tell
this young boy and our conversation soon
ended. The next week he saw me again,
ran up, and said, "I need to tell you what
15-95.indd 75 3/10/10 12:14 PM
76 Reading Academic English/ Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder, Sarah Feingold
happened at school last night." He recounted
that he was walking down the hall with
three girls after a school basketball game.
They heard a boy use a racist slur toward
another boy. The 9th grader told me that
he started to turn around to say something,
and as he was turning, he felt motion beside
him. When he had turned around, he looked
left and then right and realized that the three
girls had turned at the same time and that
the four of them had their fingers pointed
at the boy. In slightly different words, they
said, "Don't use that word in this school."
The four of them pivoted and went on down
the hall.
29 This is not rocket science. This is adults
modeling for our students the courage
and skills to intervene and, in turn, those
students modeling that courage and those
qualitites for other students.
Our Students' Strength and Courage
30 Here's one last anecdote that illustrates the
low points and the high points of dealing
with these issues. A boy—"Scott"—was
a sophomore who
was "out" in his
high school as a gay
student. Walking
home from school,
he realized that five
classmates were
following him. The
classmates started yelling antigay slurs.
Scott started walking faster but realized
that he was not going to be able to reach his
home before his classmates caught up with
him. He walked into a nearby three-story
apartment house with the idea of knocking
on doors and getting into someone's
apartment to be safe. Unfortunately, no
one was home and he was trapped in the
stairwell. The five boys climbed the stairs
and surrounded Scott. They yelled slurs that
turned to threats and then started hitting
him. Scott fell to the ground and the boys
kicked him. One of his classmates picked
up Scott by his shirt collar, held him out
over the three-story balcony, and, yelling an
antigay slur, told Scott that the next time he
would be dropped.
31 This incident was referred to the police
and the Attorney General's office. The case
went to court successfully and received a
fair amount of publicity. The next fall, Scott
was standing at the bus stop ready to go to
school when four middle school boys started
taunting him. Two of those boys picked up a
garbage can filled with disgusting, wet, and
smelly junk and dumped it over his head.
This incident was resolved informally.
The local newspaper, however, wrote an
article (without disclosing Scott's name)
connecting this incident with the one the past
spring. Shortly after
the article appeared, I
received a letter from
a group of students
who were members of
a civil rights group at
a nearby high school.
They sent the letter
to me and asked whether I would send it to
Scott because they did not know his name.
The letter reads:
We, our school's Civil Rights Team,
would like to convey to you our thoughts
about the awful harassment that you
have so bravely endured recently and in
past months. First of all, we want to tell
Young people are our greatest
resource for addressing incivility,
prejudice, and violence in the United
States.
15-95.indd 76 3/10/10 12:14 PM
Guided reading 77
you how very sorry we are that you have
been so terribly harassed and threatened.
Let it be known to you and the small
minority of people who hate those who
are different or who are perceived to be
different, that they are not supported by
the rest of society, and especially not
by us as a team. The deplorable acts of
cowardice perpetrated by these haters
are just that, deplorable acts, and are
condemned by us and the rest of humanity.
We understand how deeply painful
discrimination and harassment are, and
ask you not to despair. Remember that
the people who are responsible for the
hateful acts committed against you are
ignorant bigots whose opinions and
beliefs you should not take to heart.
Please remember that you are not
alone and that we fully support you and
denounce the haters of the world.
32 The letter was signed by the 16 members of
the Civil Rights Team and their two faculty
advisors.
33 I have had a strange and evolving
relationship with this letter. When I first
received it, I thought it was a nice letter.
I sent it to Scott and put my copy away.
But over the next weeks and months, I
kept returning to the letter, and it gradually
began to take on a great importance for me.
I now keep a copy in my wallet.
34 We hear people say that more police officers
and more metal detectors are the solutions
to school violence. We do need appropriate
law enforcement activity. But if teenagers
hear that the solution to the problem of bias
and violence is a metal detector at every
door and a police officer in every hall,
they also hear the subtle message that the
problem of teen violence is teenagers. I
disagree. I do not believe that our students
are the problem or the cause of incivility
and violence. Instead, I believe that our
students—like the students who sent the
letter—are the solution.
35 Many of our students possess the seeds
of the courage, the self-presence, and the
empathy to speak up for civility. Young
people are, in fact, our greatest resource
for addressing incivility, prejudice, and
violence in the United States.
36 When Scott went through those two awful
incidents—one in which he thought he
would lose his life and the other in which
he lost his dignity—the adult world did
a great job of addressing the issue from
a systemwide perspective. The courts,
the schools, the police officers, and the
prosecutors worked to ensure Scott's safety.
However, it took a group of students from a
different high school, students who did not
know and will never know Scott, to reach
out to make sure that he did not despair.
Those young men and women ensured that
Scott would not lose hope. I believe that
when Scott is 20, 30, 40, 50, and older,
what he will remember from those ugly
and terrifying high school incidents were
the 16 students who reached out to tell him
that he was not alone and that they joined
him in denouncing the haters of the world.
37 Our task, as educators, as parents, and as
neighbors, is to help our young people
grow their seeds of courage and empathy to
maturity—to the point where they will rely on
their own courage, resiliency, and good will
to say "No" to bias, disrespect, and violence.

LITERACIES FOR LIFE
by Paul Shaker
To meet the demands of modern life, students
need three kinds of literacy—economic,
social and emotional, and aesthetic.
1 We travel around the solar system, under
the seas, and inside the cell; we are wired
and wireless; we can cure disease and treat
disorders. With all these advances, the
issue of deciding what to teach has never
been more difficult. Curriculum designers
face exciting but daunting challenges. The
volume of data has grown exponentially,
and information technology has made
accessing that data possible by many means.
Traditional categories and disciplines are
breaking down and recombining, and new
fields of study are emerging. Paralleling this
growth in content is the public's heightened
expectations for education.
2 Those who design curriculums also face
the challenge of responding to a changing
social context. New family structures and
reconfigured gender, ethnic, and racial
identities have reshaped the communities
that schools serve. English language and
European ethnicity no longer define the
U.S. population. Diversity and globalization
have blurred cultural barriers.
3 Moreover, opinions about the role
and nature of U.S. public schools are
increasingly at odds with one another.
Privatization, charter, and home-school
movements contest the primacy of public
education. The reformers' motivations
differ, too, often aimed at corporate profits
instead of the social weal. Policymakers
and pundits—usually noneducators—often
impose policies on schools. Publishers, too,
are a powerful voice in curriculum because
of the materials that they market and the
clout of their political lobbying efforts.
4 In addition, educators face changes in their
profession. Unable to raise real incomes
for teachers during the prosperous 1990s,
U.S. schools now confront an ongoing
loss of talented teachers to other fields.
High-achieving minorities and women,
for whom education was once one of few
available professions, now take other career
paths. Out-of-field teachers and those
with emergency licenses are increasingly
prevalent: 49,000 teachers occupy these
two categories in California alone.
5 Education, the largest of all professions,
is also sub-dividing in ways that may
be perilous to its effectiveness. The
curriculum field has seen the gradual
separation of college faculty from public
school educators, each group with its own
conferences, organizations, journals, and
perspectives. University-based theorists
seem increasingly distant from the
curriculum directors who make the choices
about what students in public schools are
taught. This gradual divergence within
the curriculum field is more a function of
numbers and scale rather than of conscious
design, but it is another development that
shapes curriculum work today.
6 But what are the skills and knowledge
that students need today? How should
curriculum designers shape students'
15-95.indd 82 3/10/10 12:14 PM
Guided reading 83
schooling? We should look at what students
need and broaden both the scope and depth
of curriculum to meet those needs.
Economic Literacy
7 In the United States, where pragmatism has
a strong tradition, the least controversial
purpose for schooling is to prepare students
for economic
productivity, both for
their own well-being
and in the interest
of society. We have
tried to fulfill this
mission through
vocational education
and the practical application of knowledge
in the academic curriculum. Neglected in
this curricular tradition, however, is the
development of personal economic skills,
including an understanding of credit, real
estate ownership, retirement planning,
taxation, and investing. Understanding
topics such as these, which can make or
break families financially, is necessary for
prospering in adult life.
8 The consequences of our general ignorance
of these topics can be dramatic. Recently,
for example, the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service stopped a large tax preparation
firm from touting "instant refunds" that
were actually short-term loans with up to
a 500 percent annual rate of interest. Many
state governments are struggling to control
"payday loan" operations that advance cash
against forthcoming paychecks at similarly
exorbitant rates of interest. Consumers
have fallen victim to high-interest second
mortgages that deplete home equity, add
hidden charges, and cause default. Such
business practices aggravate disparities
of wealth, and economic ignorance leads
to victimization and financial ruin. These
scams would not succeed if the general
public had mastered the basic principles of
economic literacy.
9 Why have we been so remiss in addressing
this content in the
curriculum? One reason is
that many education critics
try to steer schooling
toward the three Rs and
a liberal arts curriculum.
The insight they miss—
and have missed for more than 100 years—
is that the best intellectual learning occurs in
a context that illustrates its practical value.
Demonstrating the impact of compound
interest, for example, makes math teaching
more effective and develops students' life
skills.
10 Often reluctant to associate themselves
with practical affairs, educators are also at
fault for this lapse. They have been slow to
adapt schooling to the practical needs of all
students, including students' needs as future
working adults. But educators do not have
to choose between theory and practice; they
can combine practical applications with
general principles.
Social and Emotional Literacy
11 Social and emotional skills should play a
bigger part in the curriculum, though such
an imperative flies in the face of the current
mania for standards and high-stakes testing.
Least controversial is the need to develop
an appreciation of citizenship and civic
values. According to the 2000 U.S. census,
Art should permeate the school
environment through painting,
sculpture, poetry, and other
forms of expression.

the percentage of U.S. citizens who vote
has decreased; about 60 percent of those
eligible voted 50 years ago, but less than
50 percent vote now. Hispanics, the fastestgrowing
and largest minority in the United
States, vote at a significantly lower rate.
Such trends threaten the social contract and
demand a strong response from educators.
12 Once again, we can convey worthy academic
subject matter while addressing this
practical aim. Print, film, and other media
can bring to life the story of participation in
a democratic society—including the place
of unions, boycotts, protests, mass rallies,
courts, and the ballot box—and in the social
evolution of the United States. Social studies
curriculum standards typically minimize
goals of this type, focusing instead on
laundry lists of lower-order knowledge
objectives. But if we cannot arouse young
people to participate in democracy, we can
expect disaffection and a weakening of
democratic institutions.
13 More controversial, but just as needed in
the curriculum,
are personal and
family skills that
affect daily life.
We have made
some headway in
health education;
teaching about the hazards of smoking,
substance abuse, suicide, and HIV among
young people has mobilized parents
and confirmed the preventive power of
education. Educators also need to address
another set of less obvious aims. Teaching
students how to manage stress, for example,
would prevent the onset of many health
problems. Obesity is a great affliction of
youth, affecting one in seven children in
the United States; teaching nutrition and
exercise could address this epidemic.
Following the principle that students learn
best when they can connect new knowledge
with their experience, educators can
integrate these topics in psychology, health
education, or biology.
14 The greatest lost opportunity in the
area of social and emotional literacy
is an understanding of developmental
psychology. Although each person's life and
relationships are colored by psychology,
few people understand the concept of
developmental stages, the characteristics of
those stages, and how they affect interactions
among individuals. The potential to advance
this curriculum is evident in the popular
acceptance of such terms as puberty,
adolescence, second childhood, and
midlife crisis, but we need to move from a
conversational familiarity with these words
to an organized, comprehensive grasp of the
evolution of personality.
A deeper understanding
of developmental
psychology could help
head off the social
and economic costs of
conflict in the home and
the workplace.
15 Literature is the best traditional subject
matter for helping students understand
human psychology. The challenge in
curriculum is to bring these psychological
themes to the foreground and to give
them the context that makes them
comprehensible. Studying films provides

in a context that illustrates its
practical value.

another vivid opportunity for teaching
social and emotional literacy while meeting
conventional expectations of appropriate
scholastic content.
Aesthetic Literacy
16 Education has an aesthetic component.
The mastery of a subject invites rewards
similar to those that come with the mastery
of an art form. This creative dimension of
education addresses central human needs—
for example, feeling competent to intercede
in one's environment and having the means
to do so effectively. Knowledge, however,
is not instrumental for action only; gaining
knowledge is a rich experience in itself,
akin to aesthetic appreciation, providing a
major source of meaning and enjoyment.
Academic study is potentially inspirational,
curative, sustaining, and generative. The
young people we teach deserve to hear us
make this case. Daily life, the media, and
the routines of school allow messages about
truths and enduring principles to slip away
when we should emblazon them on school
doorways and on classroom walls.
17 Art should permeate the school environment
through painting, sculpture, poetry, and
other forms of expression. Our readings
should be more timely and literary than
textbooks. What does Harper's—or The
New York Times—say about matters of
taste and form and about politics, science,
and the economy? The Internet also has
current, unexpurgated information about
these topics. Students and teachers should
explore together the great myth-making
machines of our time: film, television, and
popular music.
18 Schools should stand out from the other
institutions of society. What we do
obviously has a practical impact, clearly
affecting economic affairs, but education
must also provide another type of meaning.
We need the moral courage to push society
in alternative directions and to resist
the pressures that steer us away from
unconventional, higher-order aspirations.
This tension among institutional aims is,
however, central to education's purpose. The
contest of viewpoints and values generates
insights that would not otherwise emerge.
Our role is to be a source of innovation and
inspiration, to sometimes be different, to
speak other views, and to bear witness to
a human realm not governed by material
values, or, for that matter, by sectarian
religious ideals.
19 In our public schools, we are uncomfortable
with talk about spirit and soul. Such terms
remain the province of religion in U.S.
society, and their use in schools has been
discouraged. There remains the language
of aesthetics, however, and the approach to
spirituality that it represents. Students and
teachers cannot fully experience education
without an awareness of the ultimate
aims of our pursuit. The curriculum, at its
best, offers one way to think deeply about
meaning and experience.
Application and Inspiration
20 Today's schools are caught in curriculums
that are neither practical nor steeped in
higher-order learning. On the one hand,
we do not help students deal with the
powerful economic, family, and health
issues that directly affect their lives. We
15-95.indd 85 3/10/10 12:14 PM
86 Reading Academic English/ Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder, Sarah Feingold
lose an opportunity to engage learners and
to prepare them for the future. On the other
hand, we tread lightly around the ultimate
rewards of learning, fearful of grandiosity
as well as of infringement on the province
of organized religion. Our curriculum
is, therefore, both less practical and less
inspirational than it should be. Students
lack motivation because we have limited
our scope to an unsatisfying middle ground.
We lapse into a blandness that leads many
students to lose interest in school. By not
inspiring motivation, we minimize our
effectiveness.
21 Among extreme positions, the center is
normally not a bad place to be. To sustain
consensus for the existence of public
education, U.S. schools have to operate
among competing viewpoints. But schools
should not find a middle ground by neglecting
education's full range of purposes. Currently,
we achieve our balance through constraint,
neglect, and avoidance of innovation and
insight. We must create consensus from a
more thoughtful inclusion of the range of
human experience. When we, through the
curriculum, reach more broadly into realms
of application and inspiration, we will create
the type of life in schools that the times—and
our students—demand.

WHAT OUR TEACHERS SHOULD KNOW AND BE ABLE TO DO:
A STUDENT'S VIEW
Who, but students, know how teachers
really perform in the classroom?
Who else (besides other teachers) could
really help teachers do better?
Jim Black is an English teacher. His
American literature students read the
books required of them by the English
department standards. Each day, he
allows half the class time for reading and
every few days gives a quiz on plot and
characters. Before each quiz, students
beg to not have to take it. Even though
most have completed the reading, they
complain that there are too many details
on which they could be tested.
When the class completes a book, Mr.
Black assigns an essay on it. He hands
out sheets of paper with seven possible
themes outlined, but suggests that students
feel free to formulate their own theme
ideas. He leads a half-hour discussion
on possible themes. Students have three
class days to work on their essays. The
following Monday, as Mr. Black scans
the finished essays, he notices that not a
single student wrote on an original theme.
He shrugs and chalks it up to a lack of
creativity in this class.
1 Why did no students invent their own
themes? Laziness was perhaps a factor, but
the biggest reason is Mr. Black's teaching
style. He never encouraged independent
thought or in any way excited students about
the work. To them, it was just another tedious
assignment with no bearing on their lives,
excluding the grades they must receive.
2 Let's look at two other classrooms.
2.a. In math, Dan hardly tries at all. He's not
disinterested in the subject and in fact
is very good at it, but he ends up talking
in math class and gets only a mediocre
grade. The teacher spends most of the
time lecturing, with his back to the
class, them returns to his desk and
answers questions. The students stay
in their seats and do a large portion of
their work in class.
2.b. Dan's next class, chemistry, is different.
He participates actively and has one
of the highest grades. This teacher
lectures a great deal of the time, but
during the lectures, he banters happily
with the students and allows for
discussion and jokes. While students
work on an assignment toward the
end of class, the teacher wanders
around the room inquiring of each
student how he or she is doing. Dan
is the type who is often unwilling to
ask questions in front of the whole
class, or even to seek individual help
on a certain concept. When the teacher
comes to him and shows that he cares,
though, Dan willingly asks for any
help he needs.

Guided reading 91
3 Both of these teachers exhibit intelligence,
and the first teacher might even have more
experience or know the material better
than the second teacher. The important
consideration, however, is which class lets
Dan learn more? Which class does he care
for? Which subject is he more apt to want to
learn more about?
An Appetite for Learning
4 Essentially, the good teacher tells us what
is out there to learn, shows an enthusiasm
for acquiring knowledge for the purpose of
understanding, and then turns us loose to
learn at our own pace, all the while looking
carefully over our shoulders. As a senior
at Sheridan High School – a three-year,
1,000-student school in a rural Wyoming
town of 15,000 – I believe that if teachers
can motivate themselves to teach, then
the students will want to learn. Teacher
motivation can make or break a learning
situation.
5 Unfortunately, many of today's teachers
believe that they are there to teach only a
set amount of material. If the student takes
an interest in the material, he or she must
personally follow it further. Saying "Now we
will have two weeks of library time for you
to study a topic of interest" just doesn't cut it.
The majority of library time usually ends up
as less supervised talk time, and the report is
completed at the last possible moment.
6 Some teachers are stuck teaching required
courses, which students traditionally dislike,
to classes of all manner of interested and
uninterested folk. The teacher is in a quandary
about how to pace the work and how much
depth to go into. The solution is to motivate
everyone to love the subject. Teachers who
begin a course with a preconceived notion
that half of the kids will show no interest at
all are setting themselves up for a long year.
7 The teachers who love their material and
teach with the goal of making the subject
live for the students, whether the subject is
English 101 or History of World Wars, will
excel at their job. The recounting of a war in
a textbook means nothing, but allowing kids
to read firsthand accounts of what really
happened and what people really felt may
help students understand why their friends
go to foreign countries to stop such a thing
from happening again. This is teaching.
A Desire to do Well
8 Afraid of being overly tough on students,
some teachers tend to ignore discipline
problems. For example, in a classroom
where cheating runs rampant during
testing, the teacher has doubtless failed to
indicate the consequences. If cheaters are
dealt with solely after class on a personal
basis, the offense may never go on their
permanent record, they may suffer no grade
consequences, and they probably will not
stop cheating. The teacher also will have
difficulty gaining the respect of students
and peers.
9 A strong example must be set for those who
would cheat. Simply threatening to take
away a test and give a zero is not enough. A
teacher must not only patrol the classroom,
but must also have an excellent relationship
with the students. A teacher who is well
liked and respected will encounter less
cheating. If students like a teacher –
regardless of the grades they receive – they
15-95.indd 91 3/10/10 12:14 PM
92 Reading Academic English/ Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder, Sarah Feingold
will want to perform to please the teacher,
and this encourages honesty.
10 Many teachers today also seem almost afraid
of failing students. When many students
fail a class, it tells an administrator that
the teacher does not teach well. However,
a teacher who does know how to teach but
chooses to pass students who do less than
passing work helps no one. Before giving
an essay a C or a D, the teacher should
consider the letter grade the real world
would give the essay. Would this essay get
the applicant a job or gain the person the
respect of the employer? If the answer is
no, then the essay should not pass as being
average. Accepting only the best work a
student is capable of encourages a healthy
work ethic.
Traditional Evaluations
11 How can we determine which teachers need
help and how they can get it? Evaluations
clearly are one way, but, unfortunately,
not always effective. For example, at
one school, both division chairs and the
principle observe teachers. The evaluation
process involves a lot of paperwork, but the
teachers rarely benefit from what they are
told. At most schools, administrators are
concerned about the quality of teaching,
but have little time to spend with individual
teachers discussing their work. Then who
else should do this? Other teachers could
conduct peer reviews. And there is often an
overlooked group who knows more about
what constitutes good teaching than anyone
else: the students.
12 Students see their teachers every day and
know what really goes on. They can gauge
the true level of enthusiasm a teacher
imparts. All too often, when an administrator
comes in to evaluate a teacher, the teacher's
style changes in subtle ways. The teacher
may make a much more concerted effort to
maintain discipline or make sure no time is
wasted. Some teachers may even bargain
with the students to allow them a free day
or an easy test if they behave and make the
teacher look good.
A Modest Proposal
13 Here is a suggestion for structuring a
student evaluation system. Students could
volunteer, and a representative group of
teachers could meet to choose students
they deem most appropriate as teacher
evaluators. The students would use their
free hours or scheduled class time to go to
classrooms and observe teachers. This may
not be a position that many students would
want – but you might be surprised. Many
intelligent, caring students, if made to feel
as though they could be of help, would
gladly help their teachers become more
effective.
14 During observations, the students would not
only record teaching techniques, but also
would try to get a feel for the enthusiasm of
the class, the subject matter, the control the
teacher has over the class, and the students'
respect for the teacher (see fig. 1). Students
can pick up details that adult observers don't
detect. If time allows and it doesn't disrupt
the class, the student evaluator could speak
15-95.indd 92 3/10/10 12:14 PM
Guided reading 93
with class members and get their opinions.
15 Student evaluators would speak with the
teacher as soon as possible after the end of
the class to clarify any confusion. Perhaps
a group of two to three master teachers (not
tenured teachers, master teachers – there's a
difference!) could read the report. Then they
could make suggestions for improvement.
The teachers in the discussion group
might even learn from what the students
have observed. (Even good teachers can
improve.)
16 These observations and evaluations would
not have any bearing on job standing
or anything else besides improvement.
(Teachers would be more open to suggestions
and more themselves during observations if
they knew that their teaching style, and not
their jobs, might be affected.)
17 For those who doubt this method could
work, consider this: If an administrator's
children have gone through a particular
teacher's program, enjoyed it, learned from
it, and been inspired by it, that administrator
knows that teacher is good. How? Certainly
not from the results of a competency test
that notes cheerlessly that a teacher does
not know the state capitals!
18 Teachers are the crux of the entire
educational system. There is no doubt that
they experience a good deal of stress, and
a change in evaluations may temporarily
cause more. That cannot be a deterrent,
however, to those who really believe that
education is more than regular attendance
and multiple-choice questions. Without the
help of teachers, reform will go nowhere.
Reform must start at the classroom level so
that everyone sees the effects of efforts to
improve.
19 Also, everyone, from the base of the system
up, must be involved in positive change.
Change rarely comes easily. All who share
in the struggle at the start will share in the
glory in the end.
How students can Evaluate Teachers
Sample Evaluation Form
Please comment on the following topics:
•	 Does the teacher's approach to
discipline help or hinder the learning
atmosphere?
•	 Does the teacher use time effectively?
•	 Does the teacher treat students
as adults? What maturity level is
expected of the students?
•	 Do students feel comfortable asking
questions and receiving help?
•	 Is the teacher sensitive to students'
interests and needs? (for example,
will the teacher spend extra time on a
topic of special interest or need?)
•	 Does what the teacher says get
through to the students?
•	 Are students actively interested or
doing other work?
•	 When the teacher gives students time
in class to work on an assignment,
does talking center on the topic at
hand?

 Using the Skills Section
The Skills Section provides explanations and practice in the following areas:
1. Sentence Structure: learning about how sentence structure communicates meaning
2. The Verb Phrase: learning about how the verb phrase signals time, attitude and focus
3. Discourse Markers: learning to recognize these and to identify what ideas they signal
4. Substitute words: learning to identify what substitute words refer to
Each explanation is followed by exercises (called Practices). An attempt has been made to grade these
according to level of difficulty. Note that most of the items are derived from texts that appear in this
book. The first item of each Practice is done as a model for students.
It is important to link the Skills Section to the texts. You can refer students who are reading a text
to a part of the Skills Section that deals with a difficult point in that text. Alternatively, you can refer
students working on a particular language point to a text that displays that language point. It is especially
important to show students the link between the Skills Section and the Close Reading activities at the
end of each text in the Guided Reading Section. When students have difficulty with a Close Reading
activity, it shows that they need further practice in that area. Referring them to the relevant explanation
and exercise in the Skills Section will give them that practice.
You may find that students will better understand the structure of a sentence if it is read aloud to them
and if they themselves say it aloud in turn.

C. NOUN GROUPS
D. ADDITIONS TO THE VERB
E. SPECIAL SENTENCE STRUCTURES
A. THE BASIC SENTENCE
When we speak or write, we group the words in a sentence together so that they will have meaning.
If you understand how we construct sentences in English, you will be a better reader.
The English sentence has the following parts:
THE SUBJECT
This tells us who or what the sentence is about. It usually comes before the verb.
It can be one word or many words.
Examples: Crying is a mystery. Why crying is good for us is still not clear.
Food affects your health. The kind of food that you eat affects your health.
Most parents of young children aren't aware of this problem.
Exercising can help you stay healthy.
THE VERB
This tells us what the subject does. It gives us the action or the situation. It can be one word or a few words.
Examples: Crying is a mystery.
 Food affects your health.
They have a theory.
 What do they know about it?
(whole verb = do…know, core verb = know)
They have not proved it yet.
(whole verb = have proved, core verb = proved)
Our health is affected by the food we eat.
(whole verb = is affected, core verb = affected)
This will relax your body.
(whole verb= will relax, core verb = relax)
He always gets up early in the morning.
(verb = gets up)
You don't have to lie down when you do this.
(whole verb = don't have to lie down, have to = modal verb, core verb = lie down)
Skills 101
THE REST OF THE SENTENCE
The rest of the basic sentence, after the verb, can be:
•	 Something that answers the question "what?" or "who?" after the verb.
Example: This will relax you.
 Food affects your physical and emotional health.
 They eat only food that is grown organically.
 Psychologists believe that crying is good for you.
 He hates waking up in the morning.
•	 Something that refers to or describes the subject.
Example: It is only a theory. Watching TV is the most popular activity.
 Crying is helpful. He became nervous. You will feel good after you exercise.
•	 Something that answers questions such as "when?", "where?", "how?", "why?" about the verb.
Examples: Exercise helps when you are on a diet. (answers "when?")
 Small classes succeed because they give everyone more opportunities.
 (answers "why?")
 He died at an early age. She has been teaching since the beginning of the year.
 (answers "when?")
 Most people work in order to make money.
 (answers "for what purpose?")
 She manages by working very hard.
 (answers "how?")
•	 A combination of any of the above
Examples: Body language is important when you cannot hear a person
 (describes the subject) (answers "when?")
Body language can present problems because it differs from country to country.
 (answers "what?") (answers "why?")
 He remembers what he has to do by keeping careful notes.
 (answers "what?") (answers "how?")

Be careful!! Some words look like verbs but are not.
•	 Not all words ending in -ing are verbs.
Examples: Crying is useful. (Crying is not a verb in this sentence. It is a noun and functions as the
subject of the sentence. The verb in this sentence is "is".)
- They found the crying child under a tree. (Crying is not a verb in this sentence. It
is an adjective and it describes child. The verb in this sentence is found.)
Here are examples of -ing words that are verbs. Note that a word that ends
in - ing is a verb only if it comes together with a BE verb.
- The child is crying because he fell.
 (BE)
- The children have been crying for an hour.
 (BE)
•	 Not all words ending in -ed are verbs.
Example: The finished product is sent to the customer.
(Finished is not a verb in this sentence. It is an adjective and it describes product.
The verb in this sentence is is sent.)
 Here are examples of -ed words functioning as verbs.
 - He proved it. (The verb prove in the Simple Past tense.)
 - He has proved it. (The core verb is prove; the helping verb is have.)
- It was proved. (The core verb is proved; the helping verb is was.)

B. COMPOUNDING – PUTTING EQUAL PARTS TOGETHER
PUTTING TWO SENTENCES TOGETHER
Sometimes we put two sentences together, one after the other.
Between the sentences we put connecting words such as and, or, but, yet, while, whereas or so.
Examples: - The experiment was successful and he became famous.
- We watch a great deal of television but we don't ask ourselves what effects all
this viewing has on us.
- Some people like to plan everything while/whereas others prefer not to plan
ahead.
Practice #6: Can you find the two sentences?
Circle the connecting word and underline the two sentences in each of the following.
(The first one has been done for you.)
1. The experiment was successful and he became famous.
2. These two events don't seem to be connected but they have a lot in common.
3. Parents may worry about how the teacher is treating the child or they may worry about the child's
social adjustment.
4. Stress is a much overused word and it is often used to describe situations which are more exciting
than stress-inducing.
5. Children who need help may not get it while children who do not need it may unnecessarily be
placed into special programs.
6. Equality of the sexes is required by law, yet outmoded ideas about gender are still rooted in our
culture.
7. Some were failing in school while others were excellent students.
8. Social isolation and loneliness often begin at an early age, so it is vital to catch these problems
early on.
9. Negative relationships limit us whereas healthy relationships give us freedom.
10. Children mimic what they see, so teachers and parents should be careful to model appropriate
behavior.
PUTTING TOGETHER ANY PARELLEL ELEMENTS
We can put together any elements that are parallel in structure.
Examples: The experiment proved his theory and the theories of his colleagues.
 He found out that the child was ill but that he didn't need to go to hospital.
When we put together parallel elements, we sometimes leave out parts that are repeated.
Sometimes we use a substitute word instead of the original word.
96-149.indd 106 3/10/10 12:15 PM
Skills 107
Examples: He found out that the child was ill but that he didn't need to go to hospital.
He found out that the child was ill but X X didn't need to go to hospital.
 (that he is left out)
The experiment proved his theory and his colleague's theory.
The experiment proved his theory and his colleague's X
 (theory is left out)
The experiment proved his theory and that of his colleague.
 (that is a substitute for the theory)
When we string together more than two elements, we use connecting words only between the last
two. The rest are separated by commas.
Examples: They discussed the causes, the effects and the implications of the new approach.
You can study alone, with your friends or with a teacher.
During a particular program, they may eat dinner, do housework, read a magazine
or play with their children.
Practice #7 Can you find the list?
Underline and number the elements in the list. (The first one has been done for you.)
1. Multiple choice tests cannot measure personal qualities such as perseverance,
ability to work with others and creativity.

children in developing ties?)
4. Teachers, parents, other adults and older siblings should positively model appropriate behaviors
of affection, sensitivity and cooperation. (What are the 4 groups that should model appropriate
behavior? What are the 3 behaviors they should model?)
5. There are performances which are hard for a right-handed person to demonstrate to a left-handed
child – throwing, drawing, pouring from a ladle with the lip on only one side, knitting, tying a tie
or a bow, playing a stringed instrument, etc.
(What are the 6 performances that are hard to demonstrate?
6. Research shows that people who create stress response, who choose to engage in what we might
call exhilarating, adrenaline-pumping activities and who go after challenges, cope much better in
life. (What are the 3 types of people who cope better in life?)
 7. Society provides us with all sorts of methods of practicing this skill, from childhood dares to rites

of passage to fairground rides, and from spectator sports to the theater.
(What are the 5 examples of practicing this skill?)
C. NOUN GROUPS
•	 A noun group is anything that functions as a noun. It can be:
- Subject of a sentence (saying "what/who" does the action of the verb)
Most of the new students in the class came from another city.
Watching too much TV can cause problems.
That TV is bad for you has been proven many times.
- Direct object of a verb (answering the question "what/who" after the verb)
He decided to study a completely different aspect of the problem.
They want to investigate how polluted air spreads.
Many people believe that TV has a negative effect on children.
- Indirect object of a verb (answering the question "to whom" after the verb)
The researchers gave the girls in the class the same questionnaire they gave the boys.
- Object of a preposition (answering the question "what/who" after words like to, of, with, for)
They did the experiment with the equipment that was given to them.
THE CORE NOUN AND ADDITIONS
•	 Additions to a core noun add information about it. They function as adjectives.
(In the examples below the noun group is underlined and the core noun is in bold.)
Additions to the core noun can be:
- Single Words that come before the core noun. (one or more)
Two researchers worked on that project. (two adds information about the core noun.)
Two famous researchers worked on that project.
(famous adds information about the core noun.)
The company researchers developed a new product.
(company adds information about the core noun; it is a noun acting as an adjective.)
- A Phrase (a group of words beginning with a preposition) that comes after the core noun.
The researchers [in the project] worked together for many years.
(The phrase in the project adds information about the core noun.)
- An Adjective Clause (a group of words with its own verb) that comes after the core noun.
The researchers [who worked on the project] were the best in their field.
(the clause who worked on the project adds information about the core noun.)
96-149.indd 108 3/10/10 12:15 PM
Skills 109
Practice #8 Can you find the noun group?
In each sentence underline the noun group and circle the core noun.
(The first one has been done for you.)
1. I have found a solution to my morning problem.
2. A diet is a plan for eating.
3. Every night I put out my clothes for the next morning.
4. Health experts from many countries claim that we do not eat the right foods.
5. The best way to counteract stress is to breathe deeply.
6. Only a small minority of Americans exercise regularly.

9. Working offers some important advantages that we cannot ignore.
10. For people that like being busy, work can become an addiction.
11. Tears come from feelings that we allow to rise to the surface.
12. One of the experiments that they conducted led to an important discovery.
13. They asked them questions about the number of hours they spend watching TV.
14. The lack of progress in getting Americans to exercise caused the experts to change their advice.
15. Such traits as learning to delay gratification and being self-controlled helped these children when
they reached adolescence.
ADJECTIVE CLAUSES
•	 When the addition to a noun is a clause (a group of words with a verb of its own), it comes
after the noun and begins with a connective such as who, whom, which, that or whose.
These clauses function as adjectives. (They are sometimes called Relative Clauses.)
Examples: The researchers [who were chosen for the project] were the best in their field.
 People [whose diet includes too much fat] tend to gain weight.
 Most teachers prefer classrooms [which contain moveable furniture].
 The way [that you breathe] can make a big difference in your health.
 Our class project, [which the students themselves chose,] was a great success.
Practice #9 Can you recognize the clause?
Put brackets around the adjective clause in each sentence. Draw an arrow to the noun it describes.
Then answer the question. (The first one has been done for you.)
1. The students [who took part in the study] answered forty questions.
Which students answered forty questions? the students who took part in the study

students and hurts lower-ranked students.
What kind of system is "tracking"?
7. School is a place where many of our basic social skills are formed.
What kind of a place is school?
8. We can't change the fact that children are exposed to gender stereotypes from an early age.
Which fact can't we change?
9. We need to eliminate stereotypes that discourage boys from caring for younger children..
Which stereotypes do we need to eliminate?
10. Girls whose parents find ways to challenge and support them will gain confidence.
Which girls will gain confidence?
11. Research shows that people who choose to engage in exhilarating, adrenaline-pumping activities
and who go after challenges cope much better with life.
What two kinds of people cope better?
and
•	 In a sentence with an adjective clause, there is more than one verb.
Example: Programs [that attract young viewers] appear in the afternoons.
 (verb in adjective clause) (main verb of the sentence)
•	 If you want to understand the sentence, you first need to recognize the MAIN VERB of the
sentence (the verb in the main clause, not in the adjective clause).
Here are some tips for doing that:
- Underline all the verbs in the sentence. (Remember: the verb is not always one word!).
- Put brackets around the adjective clauses beginning with connectives such as which, that,
 who, whose.
- Find the verb that is NOT in an adjective clause. That is the main verb of the sentence.
96-149.indd 110 3/10/10 12:15 PM
Skills 111
Practice #10 Can you find the main verb?
In each sentence underline all the verbs. Put brackets around the adjective clauses. Then circle
the MAIN VERB. (The first ones have been done for you.)
1. The experiment [that they conducted last year] didn't produce clear results.
2. He described an incident that happened to him in third grade.
3. The social skills that are needed for developing friendships can be taught.

health problems and personality disturbances in adulthood.
9. The program that is about relationship skills was designed by Roger Weissberg.
10. Children who have good relationships with adults are more likely to make sound decisions about
friendships.
11. The researchers provide examples of techniques that adults can use to create a better climate in the
classroom.
REDUCED ADJECTIVE CLAUSES
Sometimes it is especially difficult to recognize an adjective clause because the connective (that,
who, which, whose) has been left out.
Example: The book [they read] was a classic. = The book [that they read] was a classic.
Here are some tips to help you recognize an adjective clause when it has no connective:
•	 When you see a noun followed by another noun (or pronoun) and a verb , it could
mean that the connective has been left out.
Examples: - He read only books [the teacher gave him]. = He read only books [that the
teacher gave him.]
- They chose students [we had taught]. = They chose students [that we had
taught.]
- He eats food [I wouldn't eat]. = He eats food [that I wouldn't eat.]
- These are the factors [we isolated]. These are the factors [that we isolated.]
•	 When you see a noun followed by an –ed (Verb 3) or –ing word, or followed by an ordinary
adjective, this means that the connective and the verb BE have been left out.
Examples: - They chose students [affected by violence]. = They chose students [who had
been affected by violence].
96-149.indd 111 3/10/10 12:15 PM

- He read only books [written in English].
= He read only books [that were written in English].
- He bought the painting [hanging in the hall].
= He bought the painting [that was hanging in the hall].
- They questioned the residents [living there].
= They questioned the residents [who were living there].
- Many things [obvious to others] seem difficult to them.
= Many things [that are obvious to others seem difficult to them.
Practice #11: Can you recognize the reduced clause?
In each sentence put brackets around the reduced adjective clause. Then draw an arrow to the
noun it belongs to. (The first ones have been done for you.)
1. Experiments [conducted by this team] produced very good results.
2. He can always find the book [he wants].
3. They decided to question all students affected by the change.

7. The situation described here illustrates the need for reform.
8. The student attacked by his classmates later complained to the principal.
9. Their portfolios were full of work they had done over the year.
D. ADDITIONS TO THE VERB
•	 Additions to the verb add information about the verb. They tell us more about the action or the
situation, answering questions such as:
when? where? how? why? for what purpose? despite what? under what condition?
•	 Additions to the verb can be:
(In the examples below the verb is in bold and the addition is in brackets.)
- A Single Word
The project director worked [quickly].
(quickly answers the question "how?" after the verb.)
- A Phrase
The data was collected [during the summer].
(during the summer answers the question "when?")
They interviewed the students [in order to find out their opinions].

FINDING THE MAIN CLAUSE
We often find sentences that contain a main independent clause, plus one or more clauses that give
additional information about the verb. The additional clauses are attached to the main clause by
connectives. (Note: In the following examples, the main clause is underlined, the additional information
is in brackets and the connective is in bold). These connectives act like signals, helping you recognize
the additional clauses. Once you recognize the additional clauses, you will be able to focus on the main
clause – the most important part of the sentence.
Examples: - The students watched TV [after they had finished their homework].
(main clause) (additional information clause)
- [Because the weather was very cold], they couldn't conduct the experiment.
(additional information clause) (main clause)
- [Although they refused to cooperate], the experiment was continued [after
they died].

E. SPECIAL SENTENCE STRUCTURES
PREPARATORY IT
Sometimes a sentence begins with the word "it" but the "it" does not refer to a noun in a previous
sentence. Instead it refers to a phrase or a clause that appears later on in the same sentence. In this
kind of sentence, "it" acts as a 'dummy subject', preparing us for the real subject that follows. In the
following examples, "it" refers to the underlined words.
Examples: - It is difficult to prove this theory.
- It is a coincidence that so many have done the same research.
Practice #18: Can you recognize the real subject of the sentence?
Answer the question below each sentence. (The first one has been done for you.)
1. It is believed that no one can change animal behavior patterns.
What is believed? that no one can change animal behavior patterns
2. Scientists believe that one day it will be possible to travel in time.
What will be possible?
3. It is not true that 20 percent of the students have left the course.
What is not true ?
4. It could be said that working is a positive addiction.
What could be said?
5. It is not expected that their results will match ours.
What is not expected?
6. Most educators would like it to be possible to decrease class size.
What would most educators like to be possible?
THERE IS
Sometimes we find a sentence that begins with "there" and a form of the verb "be".
This is another way of preparing us for the real subject, which appears later in the sentence.
"There + Be" has verb value, and can be paraphrased in a variety of ways.
(In the following examples, the real subject is underlined.)
Examples: - There is another way of looking at this problem.
 = Another way of looking at this problem exists.
 - There will be great shock when this news is broadcast.
 = Great shock will be felt when this news is broadcast.
 - There has never been such interest in a project.
 = Such interest in a project has never been / existed.

NOUN CLAUSES
These are clauses (groups of words with their own subject and verb) that function as nouns, answering
the question "what" or "who". Just like a noun group, a noun clause can function as subject of a sentence,
object of a verb, or object of a preposition. Noun clauses are attached to the sentence by a connective.
The connective can be that, one of the wh-question words (such as what, why, how, which, when, where,
who, which) or combinations with certain wh-words (such as whoever, whatever, whichever).
In the following examples, the noun clauses are underlined. The main verb in each sentence is in bold.
Examples: That so many students participated in the program impressed the principal.
 (subject of the sentence)
How the information was collected is extremely important.
 (subject of the sentence)
 The scientists soon found out where the problem was.
 (object of the verb)
 The survey questions were directed at whoever had voted in the election.
 (object of the preposition at)

A. IDENTIFYING TIME AND SEQUENCE
B. IDENTIFYING ATTITUDE
C. IDENTIFYING FOCUS
A. IDENTIFYING TIME AND SEQUENCE
THE VERB HELPS YOU IDENTIFY THE TIME AND SEQUENCE (ORDER) OF ACTIONS.
•	 English uses a variety of verb forms (tenses).
Each one has its own use (= meaning, time reference).
Examples: - To express a general truth or habitual action, we use the Present Simple tense.
 Most workers spend eight to nine hours on the job.
 - To show that an action was in progress in the past, we use the Past Progressive
tense.
The children were sitting around tables when we walked in.
•	 To create the various tenses, English uses:
- the core verb (in one of its three forms: Verb1, Verb2 or Verb3)
- helping verbs: BE (am, are, is, will be, have/has/had been, etc.)
 have/has
 do/does/did
Examples: - Most workers spend eight to nine hours on the job.
 (Verb1)
 - The children had been sitting around tables all day.
 (helping verb: had been) (core=Verb1 sit + ing)
•	 Here are some of the tenses that appear in English academic texts.
Notice that a tense can have more than one use (= meaning, time reference).
Present Simple
Uses: - for an action or state that is habitual (happens repeatedly)
 - for a general truth
Some typical time expressions: usually, always, often, sometimes, seldom, never, at times,
generally, occasionally
96-149.indd 125 3/10/10 12:15 PM
126 Reading Academic English/ Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder, Sarah Feingold
Form: We use Verb1 (Notice that we add -s if the subject is he, she or it; we use do or does+Verb1
in the negative and question forms.)
Positive: Most people turn the TV on every day. The average person watches TV daily.
Negative: People do not pay attention to the screen. TV does not take Americans away from other
activities.
Question: What do people watch? How does TV viewing affect their lives? What affects them?
Present Progressive
Uses: - for actions that are happening now
- for actions that are happening at the same time as other present actions
- for temporary actions or situations
- for changing situations
- for a planned future event
Some typical time expressions: now, at the moment, today, nowadays, next month, while, at the
same time, this year, in the meantime.
Form: We use helping verb BE (am, are, is) + Verb1 + ing.
In most questions, the helping verb comes before the subject.
Positive: Changes in the world's climate are becoming more and more obvious.
Negative: I am not suggesting that we stop using plastic.
Question: Are we taking care of the environment? What are we doing to help the situation?
What is happening to the world?
Will Future
Uses: to talk about predictions, speculations or plans for the future
(Note: in informal language, we sometimes use going to instead of will)
Some typical time expressions: next…, in the year…, soon, … years from now, in the future.
Form: We use helping verb will + Verb1.
In most questions the helping verb comes before the subject.
Positive: … male stereotypes discourage boys from developing skills that will help them be loving
partners and parents.
Negative: Those who took part in this project will not take part in the next one.
Question: Will education be different in the next century? How will education change?
Who will change it?
96-149.indd 126 3/10/10 12:15 PM
Skills 127
Past Simple
Uses: for actions or situations that began and ended in the past, at a known time
Some typical time expressions: last year, …years ago, in …, during
Form: Notice that we use Verb2 in the positive, but we use did + Verb1 in the negative and
question. Notice also that the Verb2 form of regular verbs ends in -ed, but the Verb2 form
of irregular verbs is not predictable. For a full list of irregular verbs, see the Appendix,
pages 201-204.)
Positive: In 1990, they conducted another experiment. (Verb 2 regular verb)
...he brought a gun to school (Verb 2 irregular verb)
Negative: Although they had a lot of data, the researchers didn't manage to prove their point.
Question: Did the experiment prove what they expected?
 Why did they do the experiment? Who did it?
 (did is the helping verb here and do is the core verb.) (did is the core Verb 2)
Past Progressive
Uses: - to describe actions taking place at the same time in the past
- to describe an action interrupted by another, shorter action
Some typical time expressions: while, at the same time
Form: We use helping verb BE (was, were) + Verb1 + ing.
In most questions the helping verb comes before the subject.
Positive: When the principal entered the room, the students were yelling and running around.
Negative: They were not participating as well as the teacher had hoped.
Question: Was the principal speaking when you entered? What was he doing? Who was speaking?
Present Perfect
Uses: - to show a direct link with the present result
- to refer to an action in the past, when we want to emphasize the present result
 (the time is either unknown or unimportant)
 - for something that began in the past but continues into the present
Some typical time expressions: just, already, never, ever, recently, lately, since, yet,
for the last... years.
Form: We use helping verbs have or has + Verb3
In most questions, the helping verb comes before the subject.
Positive: The U.S. government has spent billions of dollars on new technology for elementary
schools. As a result, American schools are the best equipped in the world.
Negative: The researcher hasn't finished his report yet.
Question: Have we received all the necessary data? How much have you received?
Who has received it?
96-149.indd 127 3/10/10 12:15 PM
128 Reading Academic English/ Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder, Sarah Feingold
Past Perfect
Uses: - to describe a past event that took place before another past event.
Some typical time expressions: already, by then, by the time…, before that
Note: If the order of events is clear (because of a time expression), this tense isn't necessary.
Form: We use helping verb had + Verb3.
In most questions the helping verb comes before the subject.
Positive: The native peoples were still in the Stone Age when Columbus reached the West Indies.
However, they had learned to supplement hunting and fishing with agriculture.
Negative: The Indians of North America had not reached the same level of culture.
Question: Had they developed weaving and pottery by the time Columbus arrived?
When had they developed it? Who had developed it?
Phrasal Verbs
Note: When the core verb is a phrasal verb, it is sometimes hard to identify the verb phrase
and the tense it is in.
Examples: - This is the third time they have taken part in an experiment.
 (helping verb = have; core verb = Verb3 of take part in)
- Is the government carrying out the programs as planned?
 (helping verb = BE; core verb = Verb1+ing of carry out)
Practice #23: Can you identify the time reference of the underlined verbs?
Choose from the following:
•	 happens repeatedly
•	 true in general
•	 happening now/temporary
•	 in the future
•	 heppened in the past, at a known time
•	 past action emphasizing present result
•	 action before another past action
Note: in some cases more than one answer is possible. (The first one has been done for you.)
1. More than 60 percent of Americans get little or no exercise. true in general/ happens repeatedly
2. Despite innumerable diets, in the last three decades Americans have become fatter and fatter.

10. Fifty-four percent of the students cheated on tests that year.
11. In this approach, students acquire a better understanding of the viewpoint of others.
12. Research has proven that children learn better when they are in smaller groups.
Practice #24: Can you identify the time sequence?
In each sentence, number the underlined verbs to show the order in which the events happened.
Note: In some cases, two actions can have the same number. (The first one has been done for you.)
1. A doctor in Tokyo found a thirteen-year-old boy who had not been to school for a year.
2. When the researchers published their findings they forgot to mention that they had conducted the
experiment under artificial conditions. As a result they were forced to repeat the experiment from
the beginning .
3. After my great uncle survived Auschwitz and came to America in the late 1940s, he got a job selling
shoes in a large shoe store. He had been a lawyer in Germany, and when the owner of the shoe shop
saw that his new salesman was able and educated, he offered him the position of store manager.
4. The boy later explained that he had completely given up hope and felt he was going to die, until
he saw that special teacher.
5. For the last few years I have studied the effects of this medicine on human beings. I am still
working on the research, but hope to be finished soon. It is hard to believe that I started this project
ten years ago. By the time it's over, I will be over fifty years old.

B. IDENTIFYING ATTITUDE
MODAL VERBS ADD TO THE MEANING OF THE CORE VERB.
Sometimes the core verb in a sentence has a modal verb before it that adds to its meaning.
English uses modals for a variety of meanings (necessity, ability, possibility, etc. ) and purposes
(suggesting, requesting). Modals often show the writer's attitude.
Examples: - They might use this new test in all the schools.
(There is a possibility that they will use it.)
 - They should use this new test in all the schools.
(In my opinion, it is a good idea to use it,)
 Here are some modals that you will find in the texts you read:
 can, could, must, mustn't, may, might, should
have to, need to, ought to, be able to, be supposed to
•	 How to recognize a modal verb:
- Some are one-word ("real") modals: can, could, must, mustn't, need, may, might, should.
They are followed by the Verb1 form of the core verb.
Examples: Man cannot live on seawater because the human kidney cannot excrete enough
salts.
 (modal can + Verb1 of live) (modal can + Verb1 of excrete)
- Some are more than one word (semi-modals): be able to, have/has to, ought to.
 They too are followed by the Verb1 form of the core verb.
Examples: Man has to see himself as no more important than his fellow creatures.
(modal has to + Verb1 of see)
We have to take care of the Earth
(modal have to + Verb1 of take care of)
•	 How to identify the meaning of a modal verb:
 On the next page you will find a list of important modal verbs and the meanings they express.
 Notice that some forms can have more than one meaning.

OTHER COMBINATIONS WITH MODALS WHICH YOU MIGHT NEED TO IDENTIFY
•	 Sometimes modals appear in past forms.
This is their form: modal + have + Verb3 of the core verb
Examples: - They must have seen a photo of the location. There is no other explanation
for their familiarity with it. (assumption about the past)
- He shouldn't have involved the principal. That's what embarrassed the child.
(It wasn't a good idea)
•	 Sometimes modals appear in progressive forms.
This is their form: modal + be + Verb1+ing of the core verb
Example: - They should be teaching them life skills now, when they are still young.
•	 Sometimes modals appear in passive forms.
This is their form: modal + be + Verb3 of the core verb
Example: - They should be given an entirely different program.
•	 Sometimes one modal appears in front of a series of core verbs.
Examples: - We cannot hide from or ignore the situation.
- They had to study, apply and then change the method.

C. IDENTIFYING FOCUS
ACTIVE AND PASSIVE VOICE – THE VERB AS A MARKER OF FOCUS
•	 The Verb helps you identify the focus of the sentence. It helps you identify the 'doer' of the
action. Notice the difference between the Passive and Active verbs in these examples:
Active: American educators are conducting research in the field of education.
 (Active verb)
Passive: Research in the field of education is being conducted (by American educators).
 (Passive verb)
In the Active sentence, the subject ("American educators") is the 'doer' of the action.
In the Passive sentence, the subject ("Research") is NOT the 'doer' of the action.
The 'doer' ("American educators") can be added (in a "by" phrase) or it can be left out altogether.
•	 Remember! When the verb is Passive, the subject is NOT the 'doer' of the action.
 English uses the Passive to stress the action rather than the 'doer' of the action.
 We also use it when the 'doer' is unknown.
96-149.indd 134 3/10/10 12:15 PM
Skills 135
•	 How can you recognize a passive verb?
The form (structure) of a passive verb is:
BE + Verb3
Note that BE (the base form of the verb) appears in a variety of forms, depending on the tense:
am, are, is, was, were, will be, have/has/had been, etc.
Note: You can easily recognize the Verb3 of most verbs in English because it ends in -ed. However,
some verbs are irregular and have different Verb3 forms.
For a full list of Irregular Verbs and their forms, see the Appendix, pages 201-204.)
•	 Here are some of the forms of the Passive Voice that appear in Academic English.
Present Simple is
am + Verb 3
are
Positive: The beginning of adolescence is marked by biological changes in girls
and boys.
Negative: Such behavior is not allowed within the schools themselves.
Question: How is this effect achieved?
Present Progressive is
am + being + Verb 3
are
Positive: The results are now being checked and analyzed by researchers.
Negative: Young children are not being asked mathematical questions in this study.
Questions: Are teenagers being asked the same kind of questions?
Will Future will be + Verb 3

Negative: Your girl will not be asked to help with the yard work, but your boy will.
Question: Will future generations be faced with the same moral issues?
Past Simple was
were + Verb 3

3. Discourse Markers as Keys to Meaning
A. HOW THEY HELP US READ
•	 In every text you will find discourse markers. These are words or phrases that signal the place of
important information in a text. They are like road signs, signaling the location of information and
identifying what kind of information it is.
•	 You will find similar discourse markers in every text, no matter what the topic or vocabulary. They
are not like regular vocabulary words, which are related to a specific topic.
•	 Discourse markers help you understand the organization of a text. They help you find main ideas
and opinions, and help you distinguish between these ideas and supporting material.
•	 Discourse markers also help you understand how ideas are related. For example, they can signal that
the writer is comparing two things or wants to show a cause-effect relationship. They can signal time
sequence and can help you identify lists, opinions, examples, definitions, purpose and conclusions.

•	 Addition
- They suggest that everyone do 30 minutes or more of moderately intense physical activity on
most days of the week. They further say that the 30 minutes of daily activity can be divided into
as many as three 10-minute segments.
- We communicate a great deal of meaning with our bodies. It is also very interesting to consider
how much meaning we convey simply with our eyes.

Skills 143
•	 Cause and Effect
 - Because body fat cannot appear out of thin air, the explanation for our increasing weight must be
that we are using significantly fewer of the calories we consume.
 - The whole study failed as a result of the misinformation given to the researchers.
- The student was traumatized. As a result, he was afraid to go to school.
•	 Purpose
- The normal pattern of eye contact when two people are engaged in conversation is that the
speaker only looks at the listener from time to time, in order to assure himself that the latter is
listening and grasping what is being said.
•	 Comparison
- The implicit curriculum (how teachers teach) is as influential on student learning as the explicit
curriculum (what they teach).
•	 Contrast
- The speaker will look at the listener from time to time. The listener, on the other hand, will look
continuously at the speaker.
- Rather than eating less, experts claim, we should be exercising more.
- Despite innumerable diets, in the last three decades Americans have become fatter and fatter,
even though national health surveys indicate that we actually consume fewer calories than in years
past.

4. Substitute Words as Keys to Meaning
A. HOW THEY HELP US READ
•	 You are familiar with substitute words, since they are part of everyday English.
Examples of substitute words are: they, it, them, this, that, these, those, some, others, such.
•	 You will find substitute words in every text. On their own, these are 'empty' words, with no specific
meaning. A substitute word is a substitute for something that appeared earlier in the text. It refers
to something or someone that the writer has already mentioned. You can usually find what the
substitute word refers to (the referent) in the lines just above it. Substitute words can refer to things,
people, events, concepts or even whole ideas and thoughts.
•	 If you pay attention to these simple words and what they refer to, you will have a better picture of
the connections between ideas in the text. This will make the whole text easier to understand.
B. SOME COMMON SUBSTITUTE WORDS
Note: in the examples below, the substitute words are in bold. The words they refer to are underlined.
•	 he, him; she, her; it; they, them
These words refer to nouns or noun groups.
Examples: - Experts took a more practical approach. They now suggest daily exercise.
- He has a new system for remembering something. He writes it down.
- Such stereotypes affect children, no matter how hard we try to filter them out.
•	 one, ones; another, some, others; more, most; some, any
These words refer to nouns or noun groups.
Examples: - Such children typically lack confidence. The fact that they don't have any
severely limits their development.
 - Many reading programs have been tried. Most have not produced good results,
but the latest one shows promise.
 - Everyone is looking for a solution. We need one that all the parties involved
will accept.
 - Teachers are always looking for new ideas. Some borrow them from their
colleagues. Others create their own.
96-149.indd 146 3/10/10 12:15 PM
Skills 147
•	 this, that, these, those
These words refer to nouns or noun groups. This and that can also refer to whole ideas.
Examples: - There are many techniques that adults can use to foster friendships in the
classroom.
 These include: ………
- Their jobs provide them with a challenge; this keeps them busy and creative.
- They work 60 to 70 hours a week. They don't do this because they have to;
they do this because they want to.
- Stereotypes tell girls that how they look is important. To counteract that,
parents should support their daughters in ways that have nothing to do with
physical appearance.
•	 his, her/hers, its, our/ours, their/theirs
These words refer to nouns or noun groups.
Examples: - They phoned more than a thousand people all over the USA and asked them
how they spend their free time.
- Our house is big. His is small.
•	 there, then
These words refer to place or time.
Examples: - He returns to his desk and works there until late afternoon.
 - At 5 p.m. he goes home. By then he feels tired from the day's work.
•	 such + noun
This word refers to the description of a noun. It can also refer to an idea.
Examples: - Teachers should model behaviors of affection and cooperation. Such modeling
will help children develop healthy traits.
•	 the former, the latter
These words refer to nouns or noun groups.
Examples: - Two approaches that may help children achieve greater competence are
problem-solving and guided discovery. The former allows for a variety of
correct solutions. The latter provides opportunities for individual decisions.
•	 which, who, whose
These words refer to nouns or noun groups. Which can also refer to a whole idea.
Examples: - At the other extreme is Alan, who denies that you can regulate your creativity.
- They decided to send their child to a special school, which was probably a
good decision.
96-149.indd 147 3/10/10 12:15 PM
148 Reading Academic English/ Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder, Sarah Feingold
•	 do, does, did, have, has, was, were, be, will, would, should
These helping verbs and modal verbs refer to the verb or the whole verb phrase (the verb + the rest
of the sentence).
Examples: - When scientists compared people who frequently watch TV and those who
seldom do, they found that there were no great differences between the two
groups.
- Although we don't have to use this approach, other schools must.
•	 Note: In some cases substitute words refer to something that appears later in the same sentence or
the next sentence.
Example: - Instead of writing her essay, the student goes out with her friends.
- It is difficult to predict the behavior of children under those conditions.
- It is true that this method did not produce excellent results.
Practice #33: Can you identify what the substitute words refer to?
Note the substitute words (in bold). Underline the words they refer to. (The first one has been
done for you.)
1. Workaholics are addicted to work. They probably wouldn't know what to do without it.
2. Many people follow diets as a way of life. Their goal is not to gain or lose weight, but simply to
stay healthy.
3. Crying removes poisons and thus it helps people stay healthy.
4. According to this stereotype, boys should be strong, unemotional and aggressive, while girls
shouldn't be.
5. The attackers felt persecuted. For most the motive for attacking was revenge.
6. Americans use an average of 300 gallons of water a day for their individual needs; this is in
addition to that used for agriculture and industry.
7. Young people turn from parents to peers for support. This transition is part of the universal process
of forming independent identity.
8. We neglect the development of personal economic skills, including an understanding of credit, real
estate ownership, retirement planning, taxation and investing. The consequences of our ignorance
of these can be dramatic.
9. Teachers experience a great deal of stress, and any changes in the system may temporarily cause
more. That cannot, however, be an argument against all change.
10. If it is necessary for the teacher to write down scores, this should be done in a manner that
promotes dignity and privacy.
11. A small percentage of children leave school because of family emergencies or crises. Others do so
because of frustrations related to poor social adjustment.

 Using the Additional Texts
The aim of this section is to provide additional reading practice, but without step-by-step guidance.
Students should be referred to these only after they have been exposed to the strategies practiced in the
Guided Reading section.
Most of these texts are authentic academic journal texts. An attempt has been made to present them in
order of difficulty, based not only on language criteria, but also on content.
These texts can be used as practice tests before exams. They can also be used for enrichment activities,
such as summary writing, summary exchange and oral presentations.
TEXT 1: LEARNING A LANGUAGE
1 Most of us think that learning a new
language is a very difficult task. We take
language learning very seriously – we
enroll in courses, buy grammar books
and dictionaries, listen to cassettes and do
endless language exercises. Have you ever
wondered, though, how a new baby learns
language? How does a baby do it? How is it
that babies learn their first language without
the help of all these accessories? How do
they manage without a dictionary, without
being able to read, without grammar rules,
and without a teacher?
2 Psycholinguists have tried to analyze
how children learn a language. Although
they have not found answers to all their
questions, they do now know that languages
have systems that make it easier for us to
learn them and that language learning is a
process with many stages.
3 All languages are systematic. In every
language there are a limited number of
sounds, a limited number of ways of
combining these sounds to form words and
a limited number of ways of combining
these words to form sentences. Every
language has systems like these to make
speech comprehensible to those who speak
that language. The speakers of a language
learn the systems and conform to them in
order to understand and be understood.
Without these systems we would not be
able to communicate.
4 One of the marvels of language is how we
use a limited number of sounds to create an
unlimited number of words and sentences.
In English, there are only about 45 sounds
and 30 patterns for combining these sounds.
Yet we can communicate whatever we want
simply by combining this limited number of
sounds and patterns. For example, we can
recombine the sounds in the word "string"
to form "ring, sing, sin, grin". We can
rearrange the words in a sentence to mean
entirely different things, as in "John saw
Sally" and "Sally saw John". This is what
makes languages so marvelous.
5 When we learn our first language we go
through a series of stages. When we are
only a few months old we begin to babble,
150-190.indd 153 3/10/10 12:15 PM
154 Reading Academic English/ Sarah Feingold, Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder
making all kinds of sounds. Some of these
vaguely express things such as hunger or
contentment, but most sounds at this stage
do not have specific meaning. Babies simply
enjoy making sounds and experimenting
with them. Gradually, as they hear more of
their own language, they learn to produce
the sounds of that language and drop sounds
that they don't need. In the next stage
babies learn to combine the sounds into the
words of their language. Later they learn to
combine the words into sentences, first oneword
sentences such as "Milk" and later
two-word sentences such as "Want milk."
Even at this early stage children are aware
of word order patterns, and can understand
which patterns belong to their language and
which don't. For instance, a child learning
English will understand and say "Want
milk" but will be confused if someone says
"Milk want". This shows that the child is
discovering the system of the language.
6 How do children do this? How do they
discover the system of their language? One
theory claims that they do so by imitation.
They imitate what they hear, their parents
correct them and then they imitate the
corrected sentences. But there are problems
with this theory. It doesn't explain how
children can produce sentences that they
have never heard before – something which
they often do.
7 Psycholinguists are still studying how
we learn language. They have found out
many interesting facts about language and
about the stages we go through in learning
language. However, we still have a lot to
learn about what makes communication
possible.

TEXT 2: GOT THE MESSAGE?
1 How can you understand what someone is
saying? Obviously by listening to the words
and sentences that person is using. If that is
the case, however, how do you explain the
fact that you can often guess what someone
is saying just by looking at the expression
on his or her face? How do you explain
the fact that the same sentence can mean
two different things when said in different
ways? Or how do you explain the fact that
you can often guess a person's intentions
just from the way he or she is standing?
2 Language may be essential for human
communication, but it is not the whole
story of communication. We do a lot
of our "talking" without words. In fact
some experts claim that actual words
contribute only seven to ten percent to our
understanding of a message. The rest of
our understanding comes from a long list
of non-verbal signals. Among these are
sound signals, such as grunts, laughter,
tone, intonation and speed. Another group
of signals is body language, such as facial
expression, eye movement, gestures and
distance.
3 Non-word sounds contribute approximately
20 percent to our comprehension. Our
tone of voice can express a wide range
of emotions, from anger to amusement to
enthusiasm to sadness. We use intonation
patterns to question, to express sarcasm and
to contrast ("That's a dog"? "That's YOUR
problem".) In addition, there are sounds
such as laughter and grunts and fillers
("well…, Umm") that tell people what we
are thinking.
4 Body language is a vital form of
communication. In fact, it is believed
that the various forms of body language
contribute about 70% to our comprehension.
It is important to note, however, that body
language differs in different cultures. Take
for example, eye movement. In the U.S.A. a
child is expected to look directly at a parent
or teacher who is reprimanding him/her.
("Look at me when I am talking to you!")
In other cultures the opposite is true – a
child is expected to look down when being
reprimanded. Looking directly at a teacher
or parent in such a situation is considered a
sign of disrespect.
5 Another form of body language that is
used differently, depending on the culture,
is distance. Did you know that in North
America people don't generally stand as
close to each other as in South America?
Two North Americans who don't know each
other well will keep a distance of 4 feet
between them, whereas South Americans
in the same situation will stand 2 to 3 feet
apart. North Americans will stand closer
than two feet apart only if they are having
a confidential conversation or if there is
intimacy between them.
6 Gestures are often used to communicate.
We point a finger, raise an eyebrow, wave an
arm – or move any other part of the body –
to show what we want to say. However, this
does not mean that people all over the world
use the same gestures to express the the
same meanings. Very often we find that the
same gestures can communicate different
meanings, depending on the country. Take,
150-190.indd 155 3/10/10 12:15 PM
156 Reading Academic English/ Sarah Feingold, Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder
for example, the gesture where you hold
up a hand, palm away from the face, and
move your fingers up and down. To most
Europeans this means "Goodbye", but to
many speakers of Arabic it means "Come
here". Another example of a gesture that
could be misinterpreted is sticking out the
tongue. In many cultures it is a sign of
making a mistake, but in some places it
communicates ridicule.
7 Another way in which we communicate
is the way we use clothing and body
ornamentation. Every culture has its
accepted ways of dressing, arranging
one's hair, painting one's face and wearing
jewelry. By adopting the conventions for
dressing within a certain society, a person
communicates that he or she is willing
to accept the standards of that society.
By rejecting those conventions a person
communicates rejection of the culture and
values of that society. Imagine a rock star
wearing a suit and tie or a stockbroker in
tights, with a tattoo and body piercing
jewelry. Dress and ornamentation, like all
languages, differ in different cultures and
also change with time.
8 The dangers of misunderstanding one
another are great. Obviously it is not enough
to learn the language of another culture. You
must also learn its non-verbal signals if you
want to communicate successfully.

TEXT 3: DOES SLEEP HELP YOU STUDY?
by Eric Hoddes
Yes – if you take the nap after you cram,
not before. Otherwise, you might be better
off staying up all night.
1 Sleep helps us remember, assuming that it
follows study. If sleep precedes study, it can
turn out to be worse than no sleep at all.
2 The beneficial effects of sleep on memory
were first studied by J.G. Jenkins and Karl
M. Dallenbach in 1924. They found that
individuals who slept after memorizing
material recalled more than those who
stayed awake. Recent experiments have
confirmed this sleep effect.
3 It doesn't seem to make much difference
whether a person sleeps immediately
after learning or waits a few hours. What
is important is the sleep. In a study by
psychologist Bruce Ekstrand and others at
the University of Colorado, three groups
of people learned a word task. One group
immediately went to bed for seven hours.
Another stayed awake for seven hours,
then slept for seven hours. The third group
stayed awake the full 14 hours, after which
all individuals were tested for their recall.
Recall was about the same for the two sleep
groups, but both had better recall than the
group that stayed awake.
Dreams and Sleepwalking
4 The procrastinator's approach – sleep before
you learn – won't help your memory at all. In
fact, a short period of sleep just before new
learning can seriously increase forgetting,
what Ekstrand calls the "prior-sleep effect".
Everyday examples of this are common: a
person is awakened by the telephone in the
middle of the night, talks for a while, goes
back to sleep, and remembers nothing of the
call the next morning. The prior-sleep effect
may also explain why a person forgets
dreams he had early in the night, or when
he sleepwalks.
5 It doesn't take much prior sleep to disrupt
memory. In another Ekstrand experiment,
subjects slept for a specified period of time,
were awakened, and given a list of material
to memorize. The researchers made sure
the subjects were wide awake before they
put them through their memorizing paces.
Subjects were tested four hours later for
recall.
6 Ekstrand found that prior sleep of 30
minutes, one hour, two hours, and four
hours significantly impaired memory. If the
students were awakened two to four hours
before learning, however, their memory
was no longer affected by the sleep. Also,
sleeping for six hours produced less
forgetting than four hours or less of prior
sleep.
The Stages of Sleep
7 Researchers have attempted to find out if
the various stages of sleep affect memory.
The Rapid Eye Movement [REM] phase is
characterized by an active central nervous
system, with increased heart rate and brain
temperature. In the four stages of nonREM
sleep the body is relaxed, with slow
and regular respiratory and circulatory
functions. The stages of sleep didn't seem to
150-190.indd 157 3/10/10 12:15 PM
158 Reading Academic English/ Sarah Feingold, Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder
matter. Usually when researchers woke up
subjects in various sleep phases, they didn't
find any memory difference.
8 Hormones may be one cause of the priorsleep
effect. Researchers Elliot Weitzman,
Jon Sassin, and Izmet Karacan, among
others, found that sleep increases release of
a hormone called samatotrophin. Hormone
levels rise quickly within 30 minutes after a
person falls asleep and remain high during
the first half of the night. The levels subside
in the latter part of the night.
9 For the last year and a half I have studied
how samatotrophin affects laboratory mice
that learned to discriminate between black
and white alleyways in a maze. They were
injected with the hormone at various times
before and after training. I then measured
memory loss four weeks later. When
samatotrophin was injected five minutes
before training, memory was severely
disrupted, but if the hormone was injected
90 minutes before training, there was no
significant difference in recall.
10 If samatotrophin operates the same way in
humans, people who were awakened early
in sleep may have had poor recall because
of the high hormone in their system. These
levels gradually return to normal after
awakening, which may account for the
disappearance of the prior-sleep effect after
the subject is awake for a while.
11 If you don't plan to go over and relearn
material you study, it is best to sleep a while
(four hours or longer, if possible) between
the time you study and the time you have
to recall the information. Don't sleep before
you study unless you allow yourself a
period of time of being awake before you
start studying seriously. And allow for an
undisturbed period of sleep.

TEXT 4: THE NATURE AND USES OF DREAMING
by Ernest Hartmann
"The connections made in dreaming
are not random. They are guided by the
dominant emotions of the dreamer."
1 A 20-year-old college student had a narrow
escape from a fire that killed several
members of his family. A few nights after
the fire, he had a vivid dream: "I was on a
beach when a huge tidal wave came along
and engulfed me. I was flipped over and
over; there was nothing I could do. I was
just about to drown when I woke up." On
another night he dreamt: "I was swept away
in a whirlwind. I was helpless, just blown
away." These dreams clearly do not picture
the details of what actually happened
to him – the fire. Rather, they reflect his
emotional state.
2 I am convinced that such dreams are by
no means nonsense. They reflect our
emotional state – our feelings of fear, terror
and helplessness. I have collected and
studied many series of dreams after major
trauma and have repeatedly come across
dreams about tidal waves, whirlwinds, or
being chased by gangs of bullies. These
dreams picture the emotional state of the
dreamers' minds.
3 In the past few decades, dreams have not
gotten much respect. There have been two
dominant schools of thoughts. One view,
held by some biologists, is that dreams are
basically random nonsense, the products
of a poorly functioning brain during sleep.
If there is any meaning to dreams, it is
"added on later" as our brains try to "make
the best of a bad job." A related view is that
dreaming may function as an "unlearning"
procedure: a dream is garbage being
thrown out by a computer to keep itself
from being clogged up. In this view, we
dream specifically about what we do not
need to remember.
4 The other view of dreams, commonly
held by psychoanalysts and therapists,
derives largely from the pioneering work
of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Freud
took dreams seriously in one sense, calling
them the "royal road" to the workings of
the unconscious. He felt that his main
contribution was his finding that, when
analyzed properly, every dream turns out
to be a fulfillment of a wish. But although
Freud appears to take dreams much more
seriously than the biologists do, he does not
place much value on the dream itself. He
continually refers to dreams as an irrational
mental product, whose value emerges
only when we analyze it by a process of
free association, leading eventually to an
underlying wish.
5 After years of research on the biology of
dreaming, I disagree with both these broad
views. I have spent many years analyzing
my own and my patients' dreams in my
clinical practice, using techniques by
Freud, Carl Jung and others. Based on
this analysis, I have no doubt that dreams
are meaningful and can lead us to useful
knowledge about ourselves. However, I
150-190.indd 159 3/10/10 12:15 PM
160 Reading Academic English/ Sarah Feingold, Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder
disagree with Freud's thesis that every
dream, when properly understood, is the
fulfillment of a wish. For example, the
hundreds of dreams I have collected of
the tidal wave cannot in any way (with or
without free association) be interpreted as
fulfillment of wishes. Rather, they provide
a context for an emotional concern.
6 When dreaming, we make connections
more broadly than when awake. Although
the connections may sometimes seem
far-fetched or strange, they actually often
make sense. Four different women have
reported dreaming of their boyfriends.
In their dreams the boyfriends looked
like their fathers. Each woman, when
she woke up, realized that her boyfriend
was actually like her own father in many
ways – something she had never realized
before. The dreams simply put together
things in these women's minds that they
had never put together in waking. While
awake, "father" and "boyfriend" occupied
different channels of thought. Only in the
broadly connected state of dreaming were
the two brought together. This connection
is both meaningful and useful.
7 Our conclusion is that dreams make
connections broadly, but by no means
randomly, in the minds of the dreamers. The
connections are guided by the emotional
state of the dreamer. Furthermore, dreams
have their own language for doing this.
Dreams obviously do not deal in words
or mathematical symbols, but rather in
pictures or picture metaphor. There is a
whole continuum in our mental functioning,
running from rational waking thought at
one end (solving a problem, for example),
through looser thought, daydreaming and
eventually dreaming at the other end. As
we move on this continuum from one end
to the other, we think more in pictures and
specifically in picture metaphor.
8 I claim that dreams contextualize emotional
states by using the language of picture
metaphor. For example, in our culture,
a trip in a car is often a metaphor for the
course of lives or relationships. Dreams
such as "I am in a car going downhill and
the brakes don't seem to be working,"
may mean that certain relationships are in
difficulty or seem to be out of control.
9 Another important question to consider is
whether dreaming has a function or use.
Is all this making of connections simply
something that happens every night and
has no other significance, or does it have a
function in our lives, and can we make use
of it? My collaborators and I speculate that
dreaming probably does have a function.
10 Roughly, the most basic function can be
called re-weaving or interconnecting.
Returning to the dreams after trauma, we
have found that the person first dreams
about tidal waves and gangs, then more and
more about other related material from his
or her life. The dream makes connections
and ties things together. It starts with a
new piece of distressing information and
ties it in, connects it with other images of
trauma, other memories related to the same
feelings. This process interconnects and
cross-connects the materials, so that next
150-190.indd 160 3/10/10 12:15 PM
Additional Texts 161
time something similar happens, it will
not be quite so frightening, since it will be
part of a woven pattern in the mind. Thus,
the dream has the function of calming the
mind and preparing it for the future.
11 What dreams seem to do after a traumatic
event is similar to what a good therapist
does. First, a safe place is established. In
therapy, the therapist must be someone
the patient gradually learns to trust; safety
comes from a sense of alliance between
patient and therapist. The patient is
allowed to tell his or her story about the
trauma or new event over and over again,
making connections to other material,
gradually seeing it in a new light. I believe
this happens in dreaming as well. The
safe place is provided by a bed and the
muscular inhibition of REM-sleep, which
assures that the sleeper will lie quietly in
bed, rather than running around acting out
the dream. Once safety is established, the
broad connections are gradually made.
12 In addition to the basic interconnecting
function of dreaming, there are many
ways in which dreams can be useful
to us when we do remember them. For
example, the women who dreamed about
their boyfriends turning into their fathers
generally found that this dream offered
them a useful insight, a new way of looking
at their relationships with their boyfriends.
13 Sometimes, the new and broader
connections made by dreaming can be
helpful in our work and in artistic and
scientific discovery as well. A number of
creative people have made use of dreams
in their discoveries. Some of the bestknown
examples are the French chemist
Auguste Kekule, who saw snakes biting
their tails in a dream, which led him to
the correct ring structure for the benzene
molecule. Inventor Elias Howe attributed
the discovery of the sewing machine
to a dream in which he was captured by
cannibals. He noticed as they danced
around him that there were holes at the tips
of spears. This made him realize that that
was the design feature he needed in order
to solve his problem. Vladimir Horowitz
and several other well-known pianists have
described playing piano pieces in their
dreams and discovering a new fingering
they had not tried previously and which
turned out to work perfectly. Robert Louis
Stevenson said that his book, The Strange
Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, came to
him in a dream.
14 I do not claim that all the hard work
of discovery happened in the dream.
Generally, the artist and scientist made
one new connection in a dream and
then developed the work in the waking
state. Stevenson probably dreamed of a
respectable doctor turning into a monster.
Then his waking writing skills took over
from there.
15 Dreams can be extremely useful in our
personal lives, in scientific or artistic work,
or even in something as basic as career
choice. I am certainly not suggesting
that we should substitute the dream for
waking thought, but why should we leave
it out entirely? Dreaming is one end of the
150-190.indd 161 3/10/10 12:15 PM
162 Reading Academic English/ Sarah Feingold, Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder
continuum, a way of making connections
more broadly than our focused waking
thought, but guided by what is important to
us. In my opinion, we should use everything
we have and allow ourselves to notice and
employ this additional connecting power
in our lives.

TEXT 5: CHILDREN WITHOUT FRIENDS
by Janis R. Bullock
This article highlights an area that
should be of great concern to educators
– children without friends. The author
notes the serious implications of growing
up friendless: "The uniqueness of peer
relationships contributes to a child's
normal development." Now, proven
techniques of identification allow teachers
and other professionals to help such
children.
1 Children who have difficulty forming
friendships and gaining acceptance among
peers have received a tremendous amount
of interest over the past decade. Research
indicates that approximately 6 to 11
percent of elementary school-age children
have no friends or receive no friendship
nominations from peers (Hymel & Asher,
1977). This figure varies depending upon
the assessment procedure used and it
may be even higher in some subgroups.
For example, children who have learning
disabilities (Gresham, 1988), or are mildly
retarded (Taylor, Asher & Williams, 1987)
may experience more difficulties forming
social relationships. Nonetheless, many
average and above-average children are
without friends. Consequently, research and
intervention focusing on children with peer
relationship problems are becoming more
extensive.
2 Research continues to seek information that
may contribute to the understanding and
awareness of these children. Many children
who experience poor peer relations are
at risk and need support. Research on the
consequences of peer rejection can provide
teachers with the foundation and rationale
for effective intervention. Teachers working
closely with children who lack friends
understand the frustration such students
experience during attempts to interact with
peers.
3 The uniqueness of peer relationships
contributes to a child's normal development.
Unlike adult-child relationships, childchild
relations are more egalitarian and
involve more reciprocal interactions.
These interactions help children achieve
competency in many areas. Therefore,
children who lack friends do not enjoy
many important benefits of interaction. Peer
relations should be viewed as necessary for
a child's healthy development.
Identifying Children Without Friends
4 In order to determine a child's status within
the peer group, researchers often use two
variations of sociometric measurement
techniques. These measurements rely on
children's perceptions of others and can
identify those children who are rejected
or neglected by their peer group. A widely
used sociometric technique is the peer
nomination method (Hymel & Rubin,
1985). In this technique, children are
asked to pick from a list the names of three
children with whom they like to play and
three children with whom they do not like
to play. In general, this procedure provides
150-190.indd 163 3/10/10 12:15 PM
164 Reading Academic English/ Sarah Feingold, Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder
a useful means of assessing children's
impact on their peers. Rejected children
receive few positive nominations and many
negative nominations, while neglected
children receive few positive or negative
nominations.
5 The rating scale measure (Singleton &
Asher, 1977), a slightly different approach,
is used to assess social acceptance or
preference within the peer group. Children
are asked to rate each classmate on a 1-5
Likert-type scale, in response to questions
about how much they like to play or work
with that classmate. Rejected children
receive very low overall ratings, whereas
ratings of neglected children do not differ
from those of average children. Although
neglected children are generally liked, they
very often lack friends.
Sociometric Status and Behaviors in
Children
6 Once researchers were able to identify
rejected and neglected children, they
became interested in determining the
behaviors associated with each status.
Information is typically gathered on child
behavior in three ways: peer reports,
teacher reports and direct observation. The
behaviors of the children are then correlated
with sociometric status.
7 Peers can provide an important perspective
on the behavior norms within a peer group,
providing insight on areas often unavailable
or unknown to adults. A common technique
requires children to characterize the
behavior of peers (e.g., aggressive, helpful,
cooperative, shy). A variety of behaviors
attributed to children by their peers are
related to their sociometric status (Carlson,
Lahey & Neeper, 1984; Coie, Dodge &
Coppotelli, 1982; Wasik, 1987). Across
age groups, peers accept children who are
considered helpful, friendly, cooperative,
cheerful and prosocial. Peer rejection
is generally associated with aggression,
disruption and fighting. Shy, quiet children
lacking social involvement are often
neglected.
8 Because of their considerable contact with
children, teachers can provide a valuable
perspective on children's behavior. French
and Waas (1988) obtained teacher ratings
on popular, rejected and neglected 2nd- and
5th-grade children. Rejected children were
characterized as aggressive, hostile and task
avoidant, while neglected children were
described as having more school behavior
problems than popular children. Coie and
Dodge (1988) asked teachers to rank 1stand
2nd- grade boys of different sociometric
statuses on a variety of peer aggression
items. Well-accepted and neglected children
were described as the least aggressive,
whereas rejected children were described
as the most aggressive. Rejected children
also scored low in conformity to rules and
interpersonal sensitivity. In general, teacher
assessments coincided with children's
perceptions.
9 Direct observational methods also
contribute to research on the assessment
of peer group behavior. Trained observers
unacquainted with children can provide
unbiased information on discrete behaviors
of children. Various studies on school-age
children (Dodge, Coie & Brakke, 1982;
Gottman, Gonso & Rasmussen, 1975; Ladd,
150-190.indd 164 3/10/10 12:15 PM
Additional Texts 165
1983) show a high degree of consistency in
outcomes. Both popular and average-status
children engage in more cooperative play
and social conversation than do rejected
children. Rejected children show many
more inappropriate behaviors than any of
the other status groups. Often alone, they
wander around the room and are off-task
during the work period. They are also more
aggressive, argumentative and likely to
engage in disruptive peer interactions.
10 Less observational information is available
on neglected children.
In general, they spend
more time alone and
make fewer social
contacts. When they
do attempt to make
a social contact, they
are often ignored.
They are characterized as being neither
aggressive nor disruptive and have difficulty
integrating with peers. They engage in
more solitary activities than other children
(Dodge, Coie & Brakke, 1982). In general,
research suggests that children who are
rejected and neglected display certain
behaviors that may contribute to their
failure to interact with peers.
Children's Status and Dropping Out of
School
11 Children who continually experience
rejection are considered to be at risk for
dropping out of school. Approximately 20
percent of children who enter school do
not graduate for various reasons (Weiner,
1980). A small percentage leave reluctantly,
generally due to family emergency or
crises. Others do so because of frustrations
related to poor social adjustment. Yet, the
majority of these students are considered at
least average in intelligence with the ability
to graduate.
12 Several studies provide support for the
hypothesis that peer assessment of low
acceptance can predict future dropouts.
Gronlund and Holmlund (1958) reported
that 54 percent of low-accepted boys
dropped out of school, compared to 19
percent of high-accepted boys. Among
girls, the dropout
figure was 35 percent
for low acceptance,
compared to 4 percent
for high acceptance.
Barclay (1966)
reported that lowaccepted
boys and
girls were two to three times more likely to
drop out of school.
13 These early studies did not distinguish
between rejected and neglected children, a
more recent concern. Kupersmidt's (1983)
study does address the subclassification
issue. In a 6-year longitudinal study of
5th-graders, she reports the dropout rate
included 30 percent of the rejected, 21
percent of the average and 4 percent of the
popular sample. Although differences were
only marginally significant, the rejected
group did show a greater dropout rate.
Kupersmidt suggests that perhaps only the
rejected children are at risk.
14 In sum, evidence suggests that many
adolescents who drop out of school
experience poor peer adjustments in their
earlier years of school. They are more
Evidence suggests that peer
rejection may be such an adverse
experience that adolescents decide
to leave school.
150-190.indd 165 3/10/10 12:15 PM
166 Reading Academic English/ Sarah Feingold, Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder
likely to drop out of school than their more
accepted peers. The effects seem to be
stronger for boys than girls, yet patterns are
consistent regardless of gender. Evidence
suggests that peer rejection may be such
an adverse experience that adolescents
decide to leave school (Kupersmidt, Coie
& Dodge, 1990). The relationship between
neglected children and dropout rates is not
so clear and needs further examination.
Considerations for Teachers
15 Children who are rejected by their peers
often report feelings of loneliness and
lower levels of self-esteem. A sensitive
and supportive teacher will be aware of
these feelings and will attempt to assess
each child's situation. Teachers can begin
by careful observation of the child. While
observing the child who appears to be
having difficulty interacting with peers, the
teacher can ask:
•	 Do the children in the class seem to
avoid, ignore and reject the child?
•	 Does the child lack certain social skills
necessary for successful interaction with
others?
•	 Does the child have difficulty interpreting
other people's cues or requests?
•	 Does the child have difficulty
communicating with others about his/
her needs and desires?
•	 Does the child act aggressively while
interacting with others?
•	 Is the child disruptive in the class?
16 Although there are no plans that work
with every child, teachers can choose from
several approaches found to be successful.
Teachers will need to choose strategies that
best fit the child's needs, are adaptable to
the classroom and support their philosophy.
17 Some children are disliked by peers
because they lack the skills necessary to
get along with others. Researchers (Oden &
Asher, 1977) have developed techniques for
coaching children in social skills. Coaching
involves identifying the child's problem and
providing some form of direct instruction
regarding strategies for use when interacting
with peers.
18 Children can be coached on specific
concepts that will contribute to more
positive interactions. Concepts that were
used by Oden and Asher (1977) included
participation (e.g., how to get started
and the importance of paying attention),
cooperation (e.g., the importance of taking
turns and sharing materials), communication
(e.g., the importance of talking with others
and listening) and being friendly and nice
(e.g., the importance of smiling, helping
and encouraging others). Coaches can assist
children by:
•	 telling them why each concept is
important to peer interaction
•	 asking for examples to assess children's
understanding of the concept
•	 reinforcing the examples by providing
suggestions when children have trouble
finding their own examples
•	 discussing both positive and negative
behavioral examples that are important
to interactions
•	 trying out some of the ideas in a play
situation
•	 assessing the situation afterwards
150-190.indd 166 3/10/10 12:15 PM
Additional Texts 167
19 Some children may benefit from practice
with younger age-mates. Coaching children
has contributed to long-term changes in
their behavior and sociometric status.
20 Children who have difficulty reading other
children's cues may benefit by watching
others who interact successfully. Low-status
children can watch a variety of successful
interactions on videotape or acted out by
adults, other children or puppets. Studies
(Gresham & Nagle, 1980; Jakibchuk &
Smeraglio, 1976) indicate that low-status
children exhibit an increase in positive
interaction after viewing models, and the
effects are maintained over time. Factors
contributing to these
positive outcomes seem
to be:
•	 similarity of the
model to the target
child
•	 explicitly identifying
the model's behavior to the target child
•	 using simple step-by-step narration to
describe the purposes of the behavior
(Asher, Renshaw & Hymel, 1982)
21 Children who act aggressively toward others
are often the least liked in the classroom.
Self-control training, also referred to as
cognitive behavior modification, focuses
on the maintenance of positive behaviors
through internal cognitive control
(Meichenbaum, 1985). In some cases,
teaching aggressive children to self-regulate
their behavior has proven more effective
in reducing inappropriate behaviors than
external reinforcement from teachers
(Bolstad & Johnson, 1972).
22 Researchers (Camp, Blom, Herbert & Van
Doornick, 1977) have taught children to
reinforce themselves directly by following
a thinking-out-loud strategy that was
found to reduce disruptive behaviors and
increase prosocial behaviors. When using
the thinking-out-loud strategy, children are
trained to say to themselves, first out loud
and then silently, "What is my problem?
What is my plan? Am I using my plan?
How did I do?" The process helps children
interrupt their impulsive behavior, keeps
them on task and reminds them of the
necessary steps to take when carrying out
their task. This training
often includes social
problem-solving skills,
whereby children are
encouraged to suggest
and evaluate solutions to
problems (Spivak, Platt
& Shure, 1976).
23 Disruptiveness is another behavior often
related to peer rejection. Disruptive
children are often off-task and engage in
inappropriate classroom behavior. The
percentage of rejected children described as
disruptive by peers ranges from 36 percent
to 38 percent (Coie & Koeppl, 1990). Two
techniques for reducing disruptive behavior
in the classroom are use of reinforcement
and token incentives.
24 Positive reinforcement, often used in
connection with modeling, has produced
some immediate positive outcomes (Asher,
Renshaw & Hymel, 1982). The behavior
Not having friends contributes
to loneliness, low self-esteem
and inability to develop social
skills.
150-190.indd 167 3/10/10 12:15 PM
168 Reading Academic English/ Sarah Feingold, Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder
of a child or group of children can be
subjected to direct reinforcement. Teachers
can make a point of praising socially
cooperative interactions, while ignoring any
undesirable interactions deemed tolerable.
Specific praise of a child immediately after
a desirable behavior provides the strongest
results. Other studies (e.g., Gresham, 1979)
used reinforcement procedures to reduce
the frequency of negative social behaviors,
and these effects were found to maintain
over time.
25 The use of tokens as a reward for desirable
behavior, in conjunction with positive
reinforcement, tends to reduce disruptiveness
and increase on-task behavior (Kazdin,
1977). In a token economy, teachers
identify those behaviors deemed desirable
and undesirable. When students act in a
desirable manner, they are rewarded with
a token of the teacher's choice. Tokens can
range from a point system, plastic disks or
plastic cards that can be exchanged for toys,
food or other privileges. Several variations
of token economies exist in schools and
institutions. Descriptions of procedures,
rules and additional considerations of this
system can be found in Kazdin (1977).
26 Although token economies have shown
success, they are not without their critics.
This procedure focuses on the symptoms
rather than the causes, and the effects of the
program do not always generalize to other
settings – such as home or play settings
(Kazdin, 1977). In some cases, the system
may not work at all. For example, Coie and
Koeppl (1990) point out that children who
lack basic skills or are unable to perform
classroom tasks may need specific coaching
in academic skills.
27 Communicating with parents will be
especially important for teachers working
with children who have difficulty interacting
with peers. The increasing number of
single-parent families or families with both
parents working outside the home means
that teachers will need to utilize a variety of
approaches to maintain contact.
28 Options may include telephone calls,
notes, letters and parent conferences. In
order for children to benefit, parents need
to have an understanding of their child's
development and progress. Teachers can
discuss their observations of the child and
share what they are doing in the classroom
that might also be reinforced at home. In
addition, teachers can ask for parental input
and suggestions. Teachers can also share
information with parents on child guidance
or parent discussion groups that might be
available in the community.
29 In some cases, teachers may find that some
children will need more assistance than
is possible within the classroom. Not all
children will respond to the techniques
suggested. At some point, teachers must
acknowledge the need for additional help.
Teachers will need to work with the family
and suggest other resources. A professional
teacher will understand the importance of
compiling resources and referrals that can
be useful for families. This information
might include services such as the school
psychologist; community mental health

counselors; and developmental screening
clinics.
Summary
30 A significant percentage of children are
rejected or neglected during childhood.
A lack of friends can put children at risk
for later problems. More immediately, not
having friends contributes to loneliness,
low self-esteem and inability to develop
social skills. Rejection or neglect by peers
is a traumatic experience for some children.
Research indicates that identification and
intervention may help modify the negative
experiences that some children encounter.

TEXT 6: A PROGRAM FOR KIDS: SUCCESS-ORIENTED
PHYSICAL EDUCATION
by Karen H. Weiller and Peggy A. Richardson
1 Creating a successful learning environment
is a challenging task for all educators.
Children should have opportunities
to experience success not only in the
classroom setting, but also in the physical
education setting. The Council on Physical
Education for Children (COPEC) recently
acknowledged that regular and appropriate
physical activity is more crucial for children
than ever before. COPEC (1992) describes
a quality physical education program as
both developmentally and instructionally
suitable for the particular children being
served.
2 Children do not automatically develop
skills, positive attitudes and behaviors that
lead to enjoyment and success in physical
activity. Therefore, it is the responsibility
of educators to create an environment that
allows for a successful physical education
program and to attempt to match the
learner's needs and desires with those of the
teacher.
3 Physical education programs have
traditionally been designed to meet
objectives established by experts in the
field of elementary physical education
curriculum. While these are important
goals, instructors often do not account
for children's needs when developing
curriculum objectives. For example,
Coakley (1990) indicated that children
in informal play settings want personal
involvement, action and an opportunity to
reaffirm friendships. Researchers in the area
of organized sport for children (Martens,
1978; Orlick & Botterill, 1975) suggest
that the main reasons children participate
in organized physical activity are to have
fun and learn skills. Without an aura of fun,
children will most likely not participate.
Thus, it appears that elementary physical
educators and classroom educators need to
take cues from experts in organized sports
for children when implementing elementary
physical education programs.
4 COPEC identified many interrelated
components as critical to a total physical
education program. The authors specifically
address motor skill development and
movement concepts, affective or socialemotional
development and physical fitness
development. Creating a successful physical
education environment, as perceived by both
student and teacher, is vital for the success
of a quality physical education program.
Instructionally Appropriate Physical
Education
5 Physical education is integral to a child's
elementary instructional program. It is
the only area of the curriculum in which
motor skills and human movement are
emphasized, along with an opportunity
to facilitate their development (Nichols,
1990). A developmentally sound physical
education program can enhance physical
fitness, promote a healthy lifestyle, give

Motor Skill/Movement Concept
Development
6 Dear Diary:
Today all of the 4th-grade class ran relay races.
I was so afraid that I would drop the baton
when it was passed to me! I started sweating a
lot and my stomach felt real funny. I know that
my team was wanting to win real bad and I was
afraid that I would let them down. If only we
could have practiced more....
7 Acquiring motor skills and movement
concepts is a key objective in an elementary
physical education program. Too often,
however, children participate in games well
before they are prepared. Many physical
education classes consist of merely playing
games or entering children into competitive
situations without prior opportunity to
develop the necessary basic concepts and
motor skills. Even when children have
practiced motor skills, the actual game
situations restrict application of those
skills by all but the most highly skilled.
This practice is inappropriate for a quality
physical education program.
8 In order to effectively acquire motor skills
and movement concepts, children need:
•	 ample and frequent practice time
•	 age-appropriate opportunities to develop
a functional understanding of basic
movement concepts
•	 appropriate clarification of the particular
motor skill/movement concept
•	 direction about the correct way to
perform the skills (after each lesson and
from lesson to lesson)
•	 opportunities to practice skills in an
open setting and to build competence
and confidence in their ability to perform
a variety of motor skills without fear of
failure (COPEC, 1992; Graham, 1987;
Wall & Murray, 1989)
9 Recognizing each child's different level
of skill acquisition and accommodating
these differences will enhance the teacher's
ability to create an environment that meets
students' needs and teachers' goals.
Social-Emotional Development
10 Dear Diary:
Today in P.E. class we practiced tumbling skills.
Some of the girls are really good, but I don't
think I'm going to like this activity. Every time I
try to do a cartwheel I feel like I'm losing control
of my body. I feel so dumb. I can't do anything
right. I'm sure all the other girls are laughing at
me. I just want to feel good about gym.
11 Participation in a quality, developmentally
appropriate physical education program
can have an important effect on children's
perceptions of themselves as socially
interacting individuals and as skillful
movers. The social-emotional component
of physical education involves one's selfconcept.
Self-concept not only includes
children's view of self, but also children's
perceptions of how others feel about them
(Gallahue, 1987). Self-concept depends
upon one's competence, feelings of
belonging and self-worth (Gallahue, 1987;
Nichols, 1990; Pangrazi, 1982; Siedentop,
Herkowitz & Rink, 1984).
12	 • Competence. Children's feelings of
150-190.indd 171 3/10/10 12:15 PM
172 Reading Academic English/ Sarah Feingold, Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder
competence depend upon how efficiently
they accomplish their movement goals.
Hebron (1966) suggests that by age 8,
children make up to 70 percent of their
decisions to participate in activities based
upon self-perceived competence. If children
believe they are unable to perform a
movement, they will be much less likely to
want to participate. Feelings of inadequacy
will lead to poor performances, thus
reinforcing an already low self-concept.
Skill challenges for children should allow
for early success, be progressive in nature
and be built upon previously acquired skills.
13 Two approaches that may help children
achieve greater competence are problemsolving
and guided discovery. A problemsolving
approach allows for a variety of
correct solutions to movement challenges.
A guided discovery approach provides
opportunities for students to make individual
decisions about how they respond to a
particular movement challenge. Increased
success will help children gain selfconfidence
and competence, leading to an
increase in overall self-concept (Gallahue,
1987; Logsdon et al., 1984; Pangrazi &
Dauer, 1992; Purkey, 1970; Siedentop,
Herkowitz & Rink, 1984).
14	 •Belonging. Elementary school-age children
want to be valuable members of a group.
Teachers must "...intentionally design and
teach activities throughout the year which
provide the opportunity for children to work
together for the purpose of improving their
emerging social and cooperative skills"
(COPEC, 1992). For example, physical
educators can incorporate games such as
Cooperative Musical Hugs, Cooperative
Musical Hoops and Numbers, Letters and
Shapes Together. These activities introduce
the idea of working together. Older children
can benefit from collective score activities.
In such activities points are awarded when
teams or groups work together toward a
common end (Orlick, 1978; Pangrazi, 1982;
Stoner, 1982).
15	 • Self-worth. Children's self-worth is based
on perceptions of being worthy or unworthy
in the estimation of others (Gallahue, 1987;
Pangrazi, 1982). Educators can ensure that
courtesy and respect are daily goals of the
activity environment (teachers should be
consistent in their positive interactions
with children) and encourage children
to praise and support each other in their
skill endeavors. As physical educators and
classroom educators display courtesy and
respect toward students and encourage
students to do the same, they aid in affirming
the importance and contribution of each
child.
16 Nowhere is the child more unique than in the
physical education setting. Teachers must
help all children experience the satisfaction
and excitement that come from participation
in physical activity. Acknowledging
children's unique and special movement
accomplishments can reinforce children's
desires to engage in physical activity and to
achieve their full movement potential.
Physical Fitness Development
17 Dear Diary:
Tomorrow in P.E. class we're going to do that
dumb fitness testing. We have to run a mile and
do sit-ups and stuff. Coach yells out our scores
so everyone can hear. I don't even know why we
150-190.indd 172 3/10/10 12:15 PM
Additional Texts 173
do this stuff. It's so boring and we hardly ever
practice ahead of time....
18 All children have the right to a well-structured
and appropriately presented physical fitness
and wellness program. The Council on
Physical Education for Children (1992)
recommends children participate in a program
that allows them to "understand and value the
important concepts of physical fitness and the
contribution they make to a healthy lifestyle".
Regular, vigorous and prolonged physical
activity is accepted as a core component of
any cardiorespiratory fitness program (Ross,
Dotson & Gilbert, 1985).
19 Physical fitness improvement activities
can be included in a physical education
program in such a way as to meet teachers'
expectations of improved physical fitness
and satisfy students' needs of fun and
enjoyment. Physical fitness activities should
be based upon success and improvement
(Pangrazi & Dauer, 1992). Although many
physical education classes do not meet on a
daily basis, children should be exposed to
activities that promote independent, daily
exercise and provide them with the tools
and knowledge to continue a regular pattern
of exercise. An appropriate frequency
minimum for children is three aerobic
exercise sessions per week (Pangrazi &
Dauer, 1992).
20 Components of a broad fitness program can
be effectively presented and reinforced by
physical education teachers. School-wide
support for a healthy, active lifestyle will
serve to reinforce children's enthusiasm.
Specific components of an appropriate
program, as well as means for promoting a
successful physical fitness program, are as
follows:
•	 Students should be taught to set personal
fitness goals that can be applied at home
as well as at school. These goals should
incorporate a regular fitness routine
that extends beyond recess and daily or
weekly physical education instruction.
•	 Children should be taught the purpose
of fitness activities, the correct way
to perform activities and the value of
maintaining fitness.
•	 Physical education lessons in the
classroom can include basic anatomy
and kinesiology (names and locations
of major muscle groups and bones).
Information should be related to fitness
activities included in physical education
class.
•	 A system that encourages challenging
yet reachable goals, as well as continued
participation and regular exercise, will
be motivating for students.
•	 Children should be able to assess their
personal fitness levels. If it is necessary
for the teacher to write down scores,
this should be done in a manner that
promotes dignity and privacy.
•	 Total school and home involvement can
effectively enhance a physical fitness
program. Teachers can send home activities
to be performed on weekends and vacations.
A fitness calendar can list activities to be
performed on certain days, allowing both
students and parents to become involved
(Pangrazi & Dauer, 1992).
21 Regular, appropriate physical activity is
the responsibility of all educators. It is
crucial that children acquire appropriate
150-190.indd 173 3/10/10 12:15 PM
174 Reading Academic English/ Sarah Feingold, Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder
skills, develop a sound fitness level and feel
positive about their movement abilities.
A developmentally appropriate physical
education program is one that meets
teachers' goals of furthering skill and fitness
development, yet also accommodates
children's interests, desires and feelings.
Recognizing individual characteristics and
making allowances for children's individual
needs will allow all educators to provide an
instructionally sound physical education
program that maximizes children's
opportunities for learning and success.
22 Dear Diary:
Today is P.E. day. I am so excited. We only have
P.E. three days a week. I wish we had it every
day! Today we will play some fitness games,
jump rope and maybe play hockey. We've been
working on hockey skills. I love going to P.E.
My teacher makes everyone feel great. I'm not
the best athlete but it's O.K.--'cause we have 50
much fun and learn lots too.

TEXT 7: THE POWER OF PLAY
by Hara Estroff Marano
Most of us think of adult play as respite
or indulgence, but having fun is no trivial
pursuit. In fact, it's crucial to mental
creativity, health and happiness.
1 The Beach Say the words and they conjure
the gentle tickle of waves against the shore,
the harder kick of surf dashing against
rocks, the slap of spray against heated skin.
For most of us, the place where earth meets
ocean is the very essence of play—antic,
full of novelty and joyful abandon. At the
beach, we are all children. As we gambol
in the shallow surf and toss in the deeper
waves, we feel the freedom of helplessness
and the satisfaction of improvising
defenses. Unburdened by consciousness
or self-consciousness, we are caught in the
moment. Suffused with pleasure, we exult
in the sheer lightness of being.
2 Yet, as welcome and wonderful as those
feelings are, play's value among adults
is too often vastly underrated. We would
all agree that play lifts stress from us. It
refreshes us and recharges us. It restores
our optimism. It changes our perspective,
stimulating creativity. It renews our ability
to accomplish the work of the world. By
anyone's reckoning, those are remarkably
worthy achievements.
3 But there is also evidence that play does
much more. It may in fact be the highest
expression of our humanity, both imitating
and advancing the evolutionary process.
Play appears to allow our brains to exercise
their very flexibility, to maintain and even
perhaps renew the neural connections that
embody our human potential to adapt, to
meet any possible set of environmental
conditions.
4 And it may be that playfulness is a force
woven through our search for mates.
Certainly, playful people are the most fun
to be around. But the ability to play may be
a strong and appealing signal of something
more. Especially among males, playfulness
can protect us. It may be a way to indicate to
potential partners that a man is not a threat
to himself, to his offspring—or to society at
large. It can truly be said that we are made for
play; after all, humans are among the very few
animals that play as adults. What the evidence
adds up to is this: we are most human when
we play—and just because we play.
5 Like art, play is that quintessential
experience that is almost impossible to
define—because it encompasses infinite
variability—but which we all recognize
when we see, or experience. So let us go
back to the beach in an attempt to understand
all that contributes to such a necessary, and
exalted, psychological state.
6 The beach is, above all else, 'Somewhere
Else', far enough away from home, office,
and everyday routines in character and
distance. That dislocation sets the stage for
us to be attuned to the moment, to relax our
focus on long-term goals. Being at the beach
invariably forces a measure of spontaneity.
We bring few of our usual possessions and
tools. We are forced to recline, stretch out,
relax. If the sand and the water offer their
own endless cache of novelty, the sun draws
150-190.indd 175 3/10/10 12:15 PM
176 Reading Academic English/ Sarah Feingold, Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder
our attention to them. And it cossets us,
taking tension out of our bodies with its
warmth. Then, too, there is the novelty of
(relative) nudity. It renders us all childlike
and opens us to the enjoyment of sensations.
It renders us ready to play.
7 Despite our readiness to play, at the beach
and other places, we Americans have a
particularly deep ambivalence toward play.
According to Cindy S. Aron, Ph.D., associate
professor of history at the University of
Virginia, Americans want to get out and
play, and we do. But we have also created
many ways that keep us connected to work.
Partial evidence: the ubiquity of cell phones
and laptop computers at the beach. The
concept of vacation—time specifically set
aside from work for play—grew from the
custom of a small elite in the early 19th
century, observes Aron in Working at Play
(Oxford, 1999). Fostered by the growth of
the middle class, the creation of a highway
system and the changeover from an
agricultural to urban society, it expanded to
a mass phenomenon by World War II. But at
the same time, notes Aron, "Americans have
struggled with the notion of taking time
off." In fact, she says, we have "a love/hate
battle" with our vacations, both wanting to
take them and fearing the consequences. Our
distrust of leisure is a legacy of our Puritan
forebears, who knew that work, not play,
was the key to their success and saw labor
as a way of glorifying God. Play, according
to this view, threatens to undermine both
our success and salvation.
8 Freud, too, disregarded play as a powerful
force. In his 1930 classic Civilization and Its
Discontents, he declared that "the communal
life of human beings had, therefore, a twofold
foundation: the compulsion to work... and the
power of love." As a result, today we often use
our leisure time not necessarily to play, but in
performance of various sorts of work, whether
it's time at the health spa or artists' retreats. It
isn't even clear whether we are playing more
or less than we used to. If we're playing more,
it doesn't feel like it. Just in the past 30 years,
there has been a cultural shift reemphasizing
work and getting ahead. "We still play, but
much of it seems to lack a playful quality,"
observes anthropologist Garry Chick, Ph.D.,
of Penn State University. "Playfulness has
been replaced by aggressiveness and the
feeling that more needs to be crammed into
less time."
9 Scholars themselves debate the state of our
leisure time. Many believe that the amount
of free time we have to use for play has
decreased since about 1970, after having
increased steadily since the Industrial
Revolution. The increase accompanied
a transition from an industrial economy
marked by hourly wages to a service
economy characterized by salaries. But the
globalization of business competition and
a general cultural rejection of the ideals of
the 1960s in favor of a new materialism have
actually eroded our free time since then.
Other experts believe we have as much free
time today as in 1970—but feel so harried by
globalization and intimidated by the speed of
things that it seems as if we have less.
10 But the big question is why we bother to
play at all. It is a tenet of evolutionary
psychology that useless behaviors—and
worse, deleterious ones, which play can
seem to be since it erodes energy, wastes time
150-190.indd 176 3/10/10 12:15 PM
Additional Texts 177
that could be spent searching for food, and
opens players to both injury and predation—
pretty quickly get selected out of behavioral
repertoires. Yet in the animal kingdom,
play increases, rather than decreases, with
increasing complexity of the brain. If Garry
Chick is right, we play because it protects
us. Chick, who has studied games and
sports in a number of cultures, contends that
the standard explanations for why we play
just don't wash. For example, the belief that
play affords practice for skills needed later
in life is true—for some animals, and then
just for juveniles. "Some animals appear to
play at things they will be doing their adult
lives," he observes. "Predatory animals play
at predation, those that are preyed upon play
at escape. Social animals beat each other up
to establish rank and hierarchy." Of course,
all animals play at sex. "It's essential,
something you have to do," Chick notes.
"Animals play at mounting. Humans play
doctor." But the difficulty is explaining why
adults engage in play, activity distinguished
by having no goals at all. "Adults really
don't have more to learn," says Chick.
Which is why in most mammalian species,
the adults leave playing to the young.
11 Chick proposes that just as humans have
selectively bred the wolf into the dog
specifically for playfulness, so we have
bred playfulness into our own selves by
sexual selection. Males, he argues, can
be dangerous. They rape and they kill,
especially when one deposes another in a
social group. Chick points to evidence that
stepfathers are much more likely to kill their
stepchildren than fathers are to kill their
natural offspring. But one sign that males
may not be dangerous either to females or
to their children is their willingness to play
with them. "So it is possible that females
seek out mates who are playful, both for
their own protection and for that of their
offspring." Men, for their part, are not
immune to the pleasures of playfulness in
selecting a mate either. Playfulness is an
indicator of youthfulness in women.
12 If playfulness is an innate biological quality
of higher animals, it is also in part a learned
behavior. Chick's studies of preschoolers
and their parents demonstrate that younger
parents have more playful children than
older parents, presumably because they are
played with more. And second-borns are
more playful than first-borns, because they
go through childhood with a near-peer to
play with.
13 Through play, contends psychiatrist Lenore
Terr, M.D., clinical professor of psychiatry
at the University of California at San
Francisco, "we get control over the world.
We get to manipulate symbols, control
the outcome of events." Terr's own nowclassic
work with children traumatized by
physical and sexual abuse demonstrates how
clearly play is necessary to mental health.
In the aftermath of trauma children lose
their flexibility. They play, but their play
is obsessive; they stay stuck, repeating the
traumatic episode endlessly. "Post-traumatic
play demonstrates that if we don't find a way
out of difficult situations, we will play much
of our lives over and over again."
14 Play is an opening to our very being, Terr
observes in Beyond Love and Work: Why
Adults Need to Play (Scribner, 1999). It
permits us emotional discharge, but in a way
150-190.indd 177 3/10/10 12:15 PM
178 Reading Academic English/ Sarah Feingold, Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder
that carries little risk. In fact, she says, play
is not just an activity—it's a state of mind,
and "all the mental activity of play comes
at you sideways." Therein lies its value:
the mental activity is never the direct goal.
Terr uses play therapy as a way to allow
children—and adults, who often remain
frozen in patterns of play originating in
fearful experiences in childhood—to create
new endings for their experience. Perhaps
for that reason, adults who play appear
to live longer than those who don't. Terr
cites as evidence the most recent findings
of the long-standing Terman study. Begun
by Stanford University psychologist Lewis
Terman in the 1920s to examine the lives
of gifted children, the study has allowed
other researchers to track the consequences
of high intelligence and other psychological
factors to health and longevity. In the
Terman group, those still surviving are
those who have played the most throughout
their lives, Terr told Psychology Today.
15 Play, argues Brian Sutton-Smith, Ph.D., is
more than an attitude. And more than an
action. While it encompasses development,
it's not about that—it's about pure unalloyed
enjoyment. Professor emeritus of psychology
at the University of Pennsylvania, SuttonSmith
is still the ranking dean of play studies.
He considers play an alternative cultural
form, like art and music. "They don't have
much to do with immediate working life,"
says Sutton-Smith, "but that doesn't mean
they're a waste of time." He calls play—are
you ready?—an autonomous intrinsically
motivated activity. We do it spontaneously,
just because it's fun.
16 Like art and music, play has a verbal and
body language all its own. Even studies of
children at play show that language use is
different during play than during normal
conversation. For one thing, it takes place
mainly in the past tense. A typical exchange
between playmates might go: "And then
let's say that we went to your place and your
mother wouldn't let us in so we had to go
home and my mother was out and so we had
to make this meal that we are making now.
OK? Is that OK?... OK. And what else did
we do?" "We did a poop. Ha-ha!"
17 Play is also stylized, with regulated ways of
behaving. Games have rules. Still, people
are very active within its frame. In other
words, when you're chased, you run. "Play
is always a fantasy, but once you get into
the frame it is quite real, and everything you
do is real. You put acres and acres of real
movement and real action and real belief in
it," says Sutton-Smith. So you scream with
fear when you're being chased.
18 Sutton-Smith is betting that neuroimaging
studies of the brain will eventually reveal a
ludic center in the brain. And he locates it
somewhere in the frontal lobes. What play
does, he says, is simulate and make more
flexible fear responses that are reflexes in
the more primitive organism or in more
primitive parts of the brain. "What we have
in play is a simulation of an anxiety attack,"
he says. With one all-important difference.
It's anxiety—complete with uncertainty—
but without the adrenaline and endocrine
response. Studies in dogs show that "they're
rushing around as if they're in extremity,
but adrenaline is not being pumped into the
system. Play looks like an emergency but
isn't. It's a simulated emergency. The frontal
150-190.indd 178 3/10/10 12:15 PM
Additional Texts 179
lobes win out over the reflexive phenomena
in the back of the brain." In the simulated
explosions and aggressions of play, we get
to explore and experiment with feelings.
It is one of the few times we are in charge
of circumstances. We have much more
autonomy than usual, and exchange habit
and boredom for novelty and the exercise
of our own competencies. And that creates
excitement.
19 Somewhere down the line, some creature
was untethered from strict necessity and
afforded then luxury of an excess action, and
then repeated making the move that wasn't
strictly necessary. "That animal was in some
way turned into a more surviving animal
as a result," says Sutton-Smith. We play
because it reflects the brains we have and the
cultures we live in. By and large, he points
out, "the connections in the brain fade away
unless used. We know that early stimulation
of children leads to higher cognitive scores.
Playful stimulation probably hits all kinds of
synaptic possibilities. It is all make-believe
and all over the map. The potentiality of the
synapses and the potentiality of playfulness
are a beautiful marriage."
20 When adults play, notes Sutton-Smith,
citing a series of Dutch studies of videogame
playing, their memory is better. They
are cognitively more capable. And they are
happier. The same is true for kids. In one
study, Austrian children were offered a cache
of toys—once they got their work done. As
a result, the children were more eager to go
to school. The teachers liked being in the
classrooms teaching and being with the
kids more, and the parents liked the school
more. And pointing to a homegrown study
at Temple University, children arriving in
grade one with a reading background were
compared with kids having a more oldfashioned
play background. The children
who got the reading instruction performed
better during the first grade but not by the
end of the year. And, Sutton-Smith reports,
"they were much more depressed. The
opposite of play is not work. It's depression."
21 Although we all need to play, we don't all
play the same way. We differ significantly
in play style, Penn State's Garry Chick has
found. In studies of tic-tac-toe players,
Chick observed differences along several
dimensions. First there were those he calls
high-velocity players; for them, the fewer
strokes the better. Low-velocity players, on
the other hand, were engaged in the play
of play; they simply enjoyed making the
moves. Players also differ by strategy. Some
people play to win. Others play not to lose;
for them, a draw is as pleasurable as a win.
Some of us like to play in ways that test
physical skill. Some prefer games of pure
strategy, like chess. Others of us opt for
word games and puzzles at any chance we
get. Some of us—the very lucky ones?—get
to play in our work. Scientists and writers,
for example, regularly play with ideas.
22 How we play is related, in myriad ways, to
our core sense of self. Play is an exercise
in self-definition; it reveals what we choose
to do, not what we have to do. We not only
play because we are. We play the way we
are. And the ways we could be. Play is our
free connection to pure possibility.
It is a day at the beach.

Being bullied in school is not "part of
growing up" or just a "rite of passage."
Some children who endure bullying never
get over the fear and the humiliation,
according to Mr. Barone. By working
together, schools and parents can make
going to school an experience that
students will enjoy, not dread.
1 Almost everybody can tell a story or two
about having once been victimized in school
by a bully. Many people can discuss in detail
the incidents surrounding the experience and
can even remember the name of the bully and
the grade level at which the trauma occurred.
Few of us go through all the years of schooling
unscathed. And while most of us get over the
fear and the humiliation, some do not.
2 Nathan Feris, a seventh-grader at DeKalb
High School in DeKalb, Missouri, decided
that enduring four years of taunting by
other children, who called him "chubby"
and "walking dictionary," was more than
enough. On 2 March 1987 Feris brought
a gun to school and fatally shot another
student before turning the gun on himself
in class. Classmates said that nobody really
had anything against Nathan. "He was just
someone to pick on," they said.
3 A set of parents in Japan have filed a
22-million-yen damage suit against the Tokyo
metropolitan government and the parents
of two alleged bullies, claiming that their
13-year-old son's suicide was caused by ijimi
(bullying). The parents also claim that the
school principal and several teachers not only
failed to intervene to stop the harassment, but
actually assisted the bullies in their activities.
The boy hanged himself in a railway restroom
and left a note naming two classmates
as the cause of his anguish.
4 It seems that bullying has been a problem in
schools for as long as there have been schools.
Why is this so? Although not encouraged,
bullying continues to be a problem for many
children because it is widely tolerated.
Teachers, school officials, parents, and
other students too often seem to stand by as
children are degraded, humiliated, beaten,
and ridiculed.
5 Left unchecked, bullying in school can
lead to tragic consequences akin to the two
cases mentioned above. Even when suicide
or murder is not the outcome, bullying can
leave lasting emotional and psychological
scars on children. Furthermore, research
has shown that bullying can extend across
the generations: the children of bullies often
become bullies themselves.
6 Why, then, do school officials, teachers, and
parents often appear to take so little notice?
One reason may be because many adults
consider bullying to be a normal part
of growing up. Confronting a bully is
considered one of the "rites of passage"
for a boy. Unfortunately for the victim, the
age-old advice to "stand up to" the bully
and fight back usually leads to more violent
bullying. Rarely does the bully back down.
A second reason why bullying continues
unabated might be that educators have
become desensitized to bullying and do
not even see it. Thus they seldom report it.
A third reason could be that the schools are
overwhelmed by other issues and problems
outside of education with which they must
deal. And finally, schools may not want to
identify bullying as a problem because they
do not have the resources to address it.
TEXT 8: BULLYING IN SCHOOL
150-190.indd 181 3/10/10 12:15 PM
182 Reading Academic English/ Sarah Feingold, Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder
Scope of the Problem
7 Students who are the victims of bullies and
school officials who hold the power to stop
them have very different perceptions of
the problem. This difference has hindered
effective prevention efforts.
8 I developed a survey that was administered
in spring and summer of 1993 to two
groups in upstate New York. The first group
consisted of 847 eighth-graders; the second
group consisted of 110 counselors, teachers,
and administrators in the same schools as the
students. The survey contained the following
definition of bullying: "Bullying is a situation
when a student or group of students is mean
to you over a long period of time (weeks or
even months). Bullying can either be physical
(hitting, kicking, and so on) or it can be
verbal (threats, name calling, gossiping, or
ignoring)." Using this definition, the school
staff members were asked to estimate the
percentage of the "students in their schools"
who had been victimized by bullying. On
average, the staff members believed that 16%
of the students had been victims of bullies.
The students in the same schools were asked
whether they had "ever been bothered by a
bully or bullies while you were in middle
school." And 58.8% of the students surveyed
said that they had.
9 The size of the difference in perceptions
between students and school staff members
suggests that the staff members do not
recognize the extent of the bullying that
students face. Bullying just does not seem to
be "that big a problem" to the staff.
Nature of the Problem
10 The same survey uncovered some interesting
facts. Contrary to what many of us believe,
bullying in school does not primarily involve
boys. Popular portrayals, such as The Lord of
the Flies and The Lords of Discipline, which
depict only boys as both the bullies and the
victims, do not reflect reality. As shown in this
study, only 47% of the victims of bullying in
middle school are boys. Thus, according to
the students' own perceptions, the majority
(53%) of the victims of bullies are girls.
11 Not surprisingly, the bullying that takes
place among boys tends to be more physical
(punching, kicking, pushing, and so on) than
that which takes place among girls (which
is usually more verbal in nature). Among
the students who said that the bullying they
had experienced was mostly physical, 89.3%
were boys. Among those students who said
that the bullying they experienced was mostly
verbal, 67.1% were girls.
12 Among all students surveyed, 10% indicated
that they had been physically injured by a
bully in school. Furthermore, the nature of the
injuries ranged from minor bumps and bruises
to some injuries that required hospitalization.
Of those students who said they had been
injured by a bully, 76.5% were boys.
Effective Remedies
13 When asked to name the three most effective
ways of solving the bullying problem in
school, most staff members named "tougher
discipline" (41.4%), followed by "better
supervision" (33.7%). Only 17.4% of staff
members listed "more counseling." Students,
on the other hand, mentioned "more
counseling" most often (43.2%); 25.8%
mentioned "tougher discipline," while 22%
mentioned "better supervision."
14 Tougher discipline is clearly important.
Bullies must be held accountable for their
behavior, or the behavior will continue.
Victims will come forward if they can see
that bullies are dealt with sternly, and bullies
will be deterred.
150-190.indd 182 3/10/10 12:15 PM
Additional Texts 183
15 Schools also need to improve their
supervision efforts. This does not necessarily
mean having more supervision, but rather
making certain that the correct areas are
supervised. Most adult survey respondents
said that they believed bullying tends to occur
in out-of-the-way and hard-to-supervise
places, such as on playgrounds and in locker
rooms. But 62.9% of the students surveyed
indicated that most bullying in their school
occurs in the hallways. (Only 10.6% of the
staff surveyed felt that most of the bullying
in their school takes place in the hallways.)
Staff members need to improve the ways they
supervise school hallways. Teachers can do
this effectively by situating themselves in the
doorways of their classrooms during passing
time. Teachers also need to be taught what to
look for when monitoring for bullying. What
teachers may interpret as accidental pushing
and shoving in a crowded hallway may in
fact be deliberate and premeditated bullying.
16 Finally, schools need to invest in inservice
training for staff members and in counseling
programs that counsel victims and bullies
alike. Several programs exist that do so. Some
involve large-group sensitivity training,
while others interweave the issue of bullying
into the curriculum.
Intervention Programs
17 The most widely known intervention for
bullying has been used in Norway by Daniel
Olweus. The main goal of the program is to
reduce the incidence of bullying in schools.
It educates teachers, other school officials,
and parents about bullying through a 32-page
booklet that was distributed to all schools
in Norway. Olweus describes the keys to
the program's success: 1) creating a school
environment characterized by warmth,
positive interest, and involvement with
adults; 2) setting firm limits on unacceptable
behavior; 3) consistently applying sanctions
against bullying; and 4) having adults act as
authority figures.
18 In Olweus' program adults closely supervise
recess and enforce "strict and straightforward"
rules of behavior. School officials mete
out consistent, nonphysical punishment to
children who misbehave in aggressive ways.
Rewards and praise are also part of the
program. Parents are encouraged to teach their
children to develop and maintain friendships.
Though Olweus believes that the peer group
can play an important role in discouraging
bullying, he places the main responsibility
for dealing with bullies on the adults in the
school.
19 E. Roland, also of Norway, has offered his
own suggestions for dealing with bullies. The
first involves having a class read and discuss
a story about bullying. The second asks
students to hand in written work that deals
with a child's feelings and thoughts about
being bullied. The third approach involves
role-playing, often reversing the role of the
bully and the victim. A fourth approach
involves the use of peer sponsors, who are
students who assume responsibility for
looking after younger children. And finally,
Roland discusses the use of class meetings in
which the group assumes responsibility for
the well-being of all its members.
20 An evaluation of Olweus' model was
conducted in Bergen, Norway. After 20
months of implementation, the number of
students who reported being bullied declined
by 50%, and there was a general reduction in
other antisocial behaviors, such as vandalism,
theft, and truancy.
21 C. St. John-Brooks describes a school in
North London where the head teacher has
made a point of attempting to reduce bullying
150-190.indd 183 3/10/10 12:15 PM
184 Reading Academic English/ Sarah Feingold, Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder
by encouraging all students to tell someone
when they have been bullied. Students new
to the school are told: "You have a right to
come to school without being afraid. This
is a 'telling school.' The rule that you must
not tell was invented by bullies, and you will
only get into trouble if you don't tell."
22 D. Stead reports that some British schools have
established "bully courts" to deal with bullying
behaviors. Once a week the court, made up of
a faculty advisor and four students, convenes
to read descriptions of bullying behavior and
mete out such punishments as after-school
detention and eating lunch in isolation.
23 Andrew Mellor's study of bullying in
Scotland outlines some proven strategies
for combating bullies. First, the school
must acknowledge that the problem exists
and that it hurts students. Second, victims
will not come forward unless bullying is
unequivocally condemned throughout the
school. Finally, parents, teachers, and pupils
need to be involved in formulating an antibullying
policy so that they will have a vested
interest in making it succeed.
24 Stuart Greenbaum lists and discusses 10
prevention and intervention strategies that
schools can employ to deal with bullying.
•	 Use a questionnaire to determine the
scope of the problem.
•	 Communicate clear standards of behavior,
and consistently enforce them.
•	 Monitor playgrounds closely.
•	 Establish a recording system for incidents
of bullying.
•	 Provide children with opportunities to
discuss bullying.
•	 Never overlook intentionally abusive acts.
•	 Contact the parents of both the victims
and the bullies when a problem occurs.
•	 Establish intervention programs.
•	 Encourage parent participation.
•	 Provide support and protection for
victims.
25 It is important to recognize that bullying does
not have to be part of a child's school experience.
It is not "part of growing up," nor is it a "rite
of passage." By working together, schools and
parents can make going to school an experience
that students will enjoy, not dread.

TEXT 9: USING MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCE THEORY
TO IDENTIFY GIFTED CHILDREN
by Carol Reid and Brenda Romanoff
In the sprawling Charlotte-Mecklenburg
school district, thousands of children
identified as gifted are tackling
challenging, real-world problems. They're
doing so in a curriculum designed for
multiple intelligences.
1 Emmanuel showed promise when he entered
kindergarten in Charlotte, North Carolina.
He was a bright-eyed, attractive child of
average size. But from the beginning, he
didn't seem to enjoy school. He was absent
a great deal. He got low scores on school
readiness tests (for example, he could not
identify colors and had difficulty with the
alphabet). Yet, at times, he seemed eager to
learn. He had a particular passion for math
and worked hard in this subject.
2 When he entered 2nd grade, Emmanuel
was recommended for the school's Program
for the Gifted. The change was dramatic.
He was the first child bounding in every
morning. Given choices of what to work
on, he often gravitated to his strongest
intellectual areas – mathematical and
spatial – while being exposed to activities
that called for other intelligences, such as
linguistic and musical.
3 Emmanuel loved the hands-on materials that
he used in the interdisciplinary, problemcentered
curriculum. His favorite part of the
week was his time in the "flow room", where
he worked with children from other classes
and with materials that appealed to many
different interests on many different levels.
He became a leader in both his classroom and
in the gifted program. He continues to thrive.
"Extraordinary Problem Solver"
4 Emmanuel is one of some 12,000 to 14,000
students identified for our district's Program
for the Gifted – about 10 percent of our total
population of 2nd through 12th graders. The
program is not new; it was launched in the
mid-1960s. In 1991, however, the program
for the younger children was transformed
when we began basing assessment,
curriculum development, and teaching
strategies for grades 2-5 on Howard
Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences.
5 The program for these children – who make
up about half of all our gifted students –
reflects the definition of intelligence that
Gardner offered in Frames of Mind (1983):
"the ability to solve a problem or make
something that is valued by a culture."
Gardner thereby proposed not only a
broader identification of intelligences but
also the demonstration of intelligence
through finding and solving problems.
6 Ann Udall, former director of the Program
for the Gifted, focused on this aspect of
intelligence, shaping the services we offer
and our own definition of gifted intelligence:
Gifted students demonstrate extraordinary
problem solving in the intelligences. When
presented with an open-ended or challenging
problem, extraordinary problem solvers
demonstrate creativity, critical thinking
and task commitment in order to reach a
productive solution.
(Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools
 Program for the Gifted 1994, p. 5).

7 When gifted children attempt to solve a
Chinese tangram puzzle, for example, they'll
always be among the first kids in their group
to complete six complex constructions.
Further, they'll typically approach the most
difficult and open-ended problems with
enthusiasm and persistence.
8 The formats for the gifted program vary
widely at our 83 elementary schools. At
some, these students attend special classes
for 90 minutes a week; at others, they attend
a "problem-solving academy" that meets
each month. At still other schools, students
work in cluster groups of 8-12 children in
heterogeneous classrooms supported by a
program teacher.
9 The programs for grades 2-5 have certain
characteristics in common. The teachers
and administrators are designing situations
in which students must use their creative,
practical, and analytical thinking to solve
actual or simulated real-world problems that
correlate with curricular expectations. These
problems may be structured or open-ended,
enabling teachers to document students'
thinking processes and production over time.
10 In applying Gardner's principles, we
developed assessment, curriculum, and
instruction simultaneously. As each
evolved, one element affected the other –
and continues to do so.
Fusing Three Philosophies
11 Our approach to gifted education for our
younger students could easily apply to
the learning of all students – and does to
varying degrees in our schools. We believe
that to be truly effective, curriculum,
instruction, and assessment should fuse
the three characteristics that are vital to
all student understanding: in addition to
using multiple intelligences, they should be
problem-centered and thought-demanding.
To elaborate:
•	 A multiple intelligences-infused
classroom personalizes and deepens
students' understanding by offering them
many opportunities to explore significant
concepts and topics on their own, to
think about a topic in many ways, and
to have different ways to make sense of
what they find.
•	 A problem-centered classroom offers
a range of topics that appeal to wide
interests, engages students in personally
meaningful problem finding and
problem solving, and enables students
to demonstrate understanding through
authentic performance assessment.
•	 A thoughtful classroom offers students
opportunities to develop a tendency
to think critically and creatively. It
also strengthens the ability to apply
knowledge and concepts appropriately in
new situations, and cultivates a reflective
disposition.
12 Our participation last year in Harvard
University's Project Zero Institute helped
us to synthesize our problem-centered
approach and our practices in teaching
for understanding (that is, making sure
students grasp concepts, skills, or principles
sufficiently to apply them to new situations).
David Perkins (Tishman et al. 1995),
codirector of Project Zero, and Sandra
Kaplan (Kaplan and Gould 1996) have been
influential in our development of thoughtprovoking
classrooms. Ongoing professional
training, demonstration teaching, and
150-190.indd 186 3/10/10 12:15 PM
Additional Texts 187
collegial collaboration form the cornerstone
of our efforts to identify potentially
gifted children and develop appropriate
curriculum and teaching strategies for them.
And we have found that scholarly thinking
enlightens our teaching and makes it more
creative.
Who is Gifted?
13 To identify our younger gifted students,
we use a problem-solving assessment. The
assessment measures linguistic, logicalmathematical,
and spatial intelligences
through activities that call for creative,
analytical and practical problem-solving
abilities. The process thus synthesizes
the problem-solving approaches of
Gardner (1983) as well as those of Robert
Sternberg (1985), whose triarchic model for
identifying, assessing, and teaching gifted
children served as the basis for the Yale
Summer Psychology pilot project.
14 Our approach is a departure from our
state's more traditional standardized IQ
and achievement tests. While we meet
state requirements for gifted education by
identifying the potentially gifted, we do it
with less socioeconomic bias. As a result,
about 26 percent of the 2nd graders we
placed in the gifted program this year are
from low-income families.
15 Our identification system has two phases:
preassessment and assessment.
Preassessment. Program for the Gifted
teachers conduct a series of model
lessons in regular classrooms that provide
opportunities for demonstration teaching
and coteaching. During this phase, children
solve problems similar to those they will
confront during the assessment.
16 The lessons incorporate materials and
activities that correlate with the North
Carolina Standard Course of Study, while
focusing on linguistic, logical-mathematical
and spatial intelligences. They also address
the analytical, creative, and practical
aspects of intelligence through activities
such as problem-solving with a map, math
story puzzlers, and open-ended problems
where students use any combination of
intelligences and any strategies they choose.
17 Both the Program for the Gifted teacher and
the classroom teacher take notes on each
child's problem-solving behaviors, and
examine and score their work.
18 Students save the work in a portfolio – a
valuable item because it documents the
child's problem-solving strengths over a
period of time. The teachers jointly review
the portfolio before deciding which students
should participate in the actual assessment.
They may bring in other information or
student work as needed.
19 We have found that this collaboration
encourages classroom teachers to develop
curriculum and teaching strategies that
enhance the students' problem-solving
abilities.
Assessment. Trained observers – including
retired and substitute teachers – administer
the assessment in a casual classroom
setting. There is one observer for every
five children, and the observers serve on a
rotating basis.
20 As the children engage in hands-on problem
solving, the observers take careful notes
on individual observation cards – a listing
of problem-solving behaviors that Maker
and colleagues (1994) have identified in
150-190.indd 187 3/10/10 12:15 PM
188 Reading Academic English/ Sarah Feingold, Judy Rapoport, Ronit Broder
their research. For example, here are some
behaviors that we look for when children
are working on the tangram puzzles – one
of the tasks used to identify spatial and
logical problem solving:
•	 Uses logical strategy for adding or
substituting pieces without clues.
•	 Incorporates clues and new information.
•	 Solves complex problems quickly.
•	 Persists in difficult tasks.
•	 Seems excited and absorbed in work.
•	 Doesn't want to stop.
21 After selecting the most exemplary products
produced for each task, the observers
rate each student's total performance on a
four-point scale: always evident, strongly
evident, evident, or not evident. (Emmanuel
was identified as a strongly evident problem
solver in math and spatial intelligences and
he showed evidence of linguistic ability.)
22 If a child receives scores of strongly or
always evident in two out of the three
intelligences, the team identifies the child
for a variety of interdisciplinary services
offered by teachers in the Program for the
Gifted. These range from direct services,
such as instructing students in small
homogeneous groups, to coplanning and
coteaching in classrooms.
23 Even though all schools have special
programming for the gifted, these students
obviously are gifted all week long. We must
offer appropriate, high-quality services in
every setting, including the heterogeneous
classrooms where they spend most of their
time. The student profiles that result from
the assessments help teachers understand
the students' strengths and personalize their
instruction.
24 Our initial research indicates that within
two years, students identified as gifted
perform 17 percent to 20 percent higher
on standardized math and reading tests
than do students who were referred but
not identified as gifted. But the benefits
are not limited to the gifted students:
As we work more collaboratively with
classroom teachers, we find that we are
creating problem-centered and thoughtful
environments for all students.
Curriculum in Action: Food for Thought
25 An essential goal of learning is to explore
and understand the connections among
things. Our 4th grade curriculum for gifted
students, called Food for Thought, centers
on this goal.
Global themes/big ideas. The curriculum
begins with a global theme that has had
great significance for many cultures down
through the ages – universal concepts
such as change, relationships, systems,
and conflicts. Students explore big ideas
or hypotheses related to the theme, first
developing a series of big idea statements.
26 For example, one 4th grade class's global
theme was "Systems". The teacher began by
asking, "What would you most want your
grandchild to understand about this theme?"
Based on this question, the children decided
to explore the following big ideas in their
study of systems:
•	 Systems create order.
•	 Systems are interdependent.
•	 Systems work together to complete a
mission.
•	 Systems can bring about change.
27 Thinkpoints. Next, teachers and students
150-190.indd 188 3/10/10 12:15 PM
Additional Texts 189
identify a problem-centered thinkpoint
associated with the big idea – an
important, engaging topic that has great
depth and significance, leads to genuine
inquiry, and can be investigated from a
variety of discipline-related entry points
or perspectives. Gardner's (1991) five
entry points are narrative, quantitative,
foundational/existential, aesthetic, and
experiential/hands-on.
28 Our 4th graders chose "What can we do
about hungry children?" as their thinkpoint.
They investigated the question through
the perspectives of various stakeholders:
a nutritionist (experiential/hands-on),
a journalist (narrative), an economist
(quantitative), a legislator and a nonprofit
agency (foundational), and an advertiser
and a social activist (aesthetic).
29 Vital questions. Teachers must also be very
clear about what they want their students to
understand. Once teachers clarify the focus,
they can then develop appropriate questions
(vital question links) that explicitly connect
the big ideas to the thinkpoint. This series of
questions weaves throughout the curriculum,
also incorporating connections between the
entry points and content goals.
Our vital question links included:
•	 What is a system?
•	 How do systems work together?
•	 What are my ethical responsibilities as a
subsystem member?
•	 How do systems change?
•	 What can I do to change a system?
30 Understanding performances. Students
demonstrate that they understand through
hands-on activities with "minds-on
purpose" (understanding performances that
connect classroom content, thinking, and
research). These activities call for rigorous
content, thinking and research skills,
engaging students and helping them develop
thoughtful, intellectual – even scholarly –
dispositions. Understanding performances
connect students' personal experiences and
intelligences to rich, often collaborative
learning. They range from structured
exploration to open-ended "culmination."
31 For example, the teacher might ask:
•	 As a legislator, identify any bias or
discrimination in hiring or housing
practices that results in people's inability
to afford food.
•	 As a journalist, gather information to
support a viewpoint about hunger that
opposes your own.
•	 As a nutritionist, invent a food distribution
system to help hungry children.
Authentic Performance Assessment
32 Authentic and reflective performance
assessments – whether done by students,
teachers, or community members – show
students that they truly understand. Rubrics
consist of clear criteria that correspond to
the vital question links and content goals.
33 Performance assessments for our hunger
study included reflective journals, a Kids'
Café that students created to serve meals
to hungry kids, and a presentation that the
students made to their peers at our school
district's annual Kids' Conference for
community problem solvers.
34 Students write their responses in reflective
journals and portfolio collections,

understanding throughout the study.
Appropriate assessment should answer
the question "So what?" and lead to the
question "Now what?"
35 As we noted earlier, we developed our
assessment methods at the same time as
we were developing our curriculum and
instructional approaches. We will continue
to develop even closer connections between
assessment and curriculum.
36 Because the multiple intelligences theory
has helped us to recognize students'
strengths, our teachers are better able
to shape classrooms that truly engage
children's curiosity and enable them to learn
and create in many ways. Ideally, these are
places where intriguing problems ignite
children's passion for learning, crystallize
their interests, and lead to purposeful action.

 Using The Appendix
Glossary
Encourage students to look words up only after they have attempted to guess their meanings from
the context. You might want to ask them to identify the part of speech of a word before looking up its
meaning. Since most of these words appear repeatedly, it might be useful to have students mark words
on the list as they encounter them in texts. This will encourage them to learn their meanings early on.
List of Irregular Verbs
This list can be used to help students find the meaning of irregular verbs that they do not recognize.
Show them how looking up the second or third form of an irregular verb gives them the first form,
which they can then look up in a dictionary.
Prefixes, Suffixes and Roots as Keys to Meaning
Refer students to these lists as they come across specific examples of prefixes, suffixes or roots in their
reading of texts. Show them how to use these word parts to get at the meaning of words.
Careful training in how to use this Appendix will help students become more confident, independent
readers.

3. PREFIXES, SUFFIXES & ROOTS as keys to meaning
Many English words can be divided into parts that have meanings. Learning these word parts will help
you unlock the meaning of unfamiliar words. There are three kinds of word parts: prefixes, suffixes
and roots.
A. PREFIXES are word parts that come at the beginning
of words.
They change the meaning of words. For example, the prefix re- means "again". When we add it to a
word, we add the meaning of "again" to the original word.
Examples: do  redo (do again)
 write  rewrite (write again)
Here is a list of common English prefixes.
PREFIX USUAL MEANING EXAMPLE
a not, without asocial, asymmetrical, amoral
ambi- both, double, two ambiguous, ambidextrous
ante- before, earlier antedate
anti- against anti-war, antisocial
arch- first, main, chief archetype
audi- audio- hearing auditorium, audible
auto- self automatic, autobiography
bi- two, occurring twice in
one period
bicycle, biweekly, bi-monthly, bilingual

B. SUFFIXES are word parts that come at the end of
words.
They can change the meaning of words, but most important, they show the grammatical function (the
"part of speech") of a word.
For example, the suffix -tion at the end of a word shows that the word is a noun. Adding -ion or tion to
a verb is one way of changing it into a noun.
Examples: invite (verb)  invitation (noun)
direct (verb)  direction (noun)
Another example is the suffix -ize, which is a sign that the word is a verb.
Adding -ize to a noun is one way of changing it into a verb.
Examples: apology (noun)  apologize (verb)
sympathy (noun)  sympathize (verb)

C. ROOTS are word parts that carry the basic meaning
of the word.
They are not used alone. Instead, they are combined with other word parts.
For example, the root cycl means "circle". English has created many words using this root, such as:
bicycle, motorcycle. Another example is the root graph, which relates to writing. From this root
English has created many words, such as: autograph, graphology, graphics.
Here are a few common roots used in English.
